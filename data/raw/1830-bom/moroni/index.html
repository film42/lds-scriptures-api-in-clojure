    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1830 Book of Mormon<br />Moroni</strong></h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1:1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the  people of Jared, I had supposed not to have written more, but I have not as yet  perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites, lest they should destroy  me.</p> <p>1:2 For behold, their wars are exceeding fierce among themselves; and because  of their hatred, they put to death every Nephite that will not deny Christ. And  I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ;</p> <p>1:3 wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can, for the safety of mine own life.</p> <p>1:4 Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had  supposed: for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I write a few  more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren, the Lamanites,  in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>2:1 The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the twelve whom  he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them.</p> <p>2:2 And he called them by name, saying, Ye shall call on the Father in my  name, in mighty prayer; and after that ye have done this, ye shall have power  that on him whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in  my name shall ye give it: for thus do mine apostles.</p> <p>2:3 Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first  appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as  many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>3:1 The manner which the disciples, which were called the elders of the  church, ordained priests and teachers.</p> <p>3:2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they laid  their hands upon them, and said,</p> <p>3:3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest; (or if he be a  teacher,) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach repentance and remission of  sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end.  Amen.</p> <p>3:4 And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers, according to  the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the power of  the Holy Ghost, which was in them.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>4:1 The manner of their elders and priests administering the flesh and blood  of Christ unto the church. And they administered it according to the  commandments of Christ; wherefore we know that the manner to be true: and the  elder or priest did minister it.</p> <p>4:2 And they did kneel down with the church, and pray to the Father in the  name of Christ, saying,</p> <p>4:3 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son Jesus  Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake  of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto  thee, O God the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name  of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath  given them, that they may always have his spirit to be with them. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>5:1 The manner of administering the wine. Behold, they took the cup, and  said,</p> <p>5:2 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy Son Jesus  Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls of all those who drink of  it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed  for them, that they may witness unto thee, O God the Eternal Father, that they  do always remember him, that they may have his spirit to be with them. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>6:1 And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers  were baptized; and they were not baptized, save they brought forth fruit meet  that they were worthy of it;</p> <p>6:2 neither did they receive any unto baptism, save they came forth with a  broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they  truly repented of all their sins.</p> <p>6:3 And none were received unto baptism, save they took upon them the name of  Christ, having a determination to serve him unto the end.</p> <p>6:4 And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and  cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of  the church of Christ, and their names were taken, that they might be remembered  and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep  them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ,  who was the author and the finisher of their faith.</p> <p>6:5 And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak  one with another concerning the welfare of their souls;</p> <p>6:6 and they did meet together oft to partake of the bread and wine, in  remembrance of the Lord Jesus;</p> <p>6:7 and they were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity among  them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and three witnesses of the church  did condemn them before the elders; if they repented not, and confessed not,  their names were blotted out, and they were not numbered among the people of  Christ;</p> <p>6:8 but as oft as they repented, and sought forgiveness, with real intent,  they were forgiven.</p> <p>6:9 And their meetings were conducted by the church, after the manner of the  workings of the spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost: for as the power of  the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or exhort, or to pray, or to  supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>7:1 And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon, which he  spake concerning faith, hope, and charity: for after this manner did he speak  unto the people as he taught them in the synagogue which they had built for the  place of worship.</p> <p>7:2 And now I, Moroni, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by the  grace of God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because  of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted to speak unto you at  this time;</p> <p>7:3 wherefore I would speak unto you that are of the church, that are the  peaceable followers of Christ. and have obtained a sufficient hope, by which ye  can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time hence forth, until ye shall  rest with him in Heaven.</p> <p>7:4 And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your  peaceable walk with the children of men:</p> <p>7:5 for I remember the word of God, which saith, By their works ye shall know  them: for if their works be good, then they are good also.</p> <p>7:6 For behold, God hath said, A man being evil, cannot do that which is  good: for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with  real intent, it profiteth him nothing.</p> <p>7:7 For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.</p> <p>7:8 For behold, if a man being evil, giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly;  wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift;  wherefore he is counted evil before God.</p> <p>7:9 And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray, and  not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing: for God  receiveth none such;</p> <p>7:10 wherefore, a man being evil, cannot do that which is good; neither will  he give a good gift.</p> <p>7:11 For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water; wherefore a  man being the servant of the Devil, cannot follow Christ; and if he follow  Christ, he cannot be a servant of the Devil. Wherefore, all things which are  good, cometh of God; and that which is evil, cometh of the Devil:</p> <p>7:12 for the Devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him  continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil  continually.</p> <p>7:13 But behold, that which is of God, inviteth and enticeth to do good  continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and  to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.</p> <p>7:14 Wherefore take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that  which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God, to be of the  Devil.</p> <p>7:15 For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge is as plain, that  ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as daylight is from the dark night.</p> <p>7:16 For behold, the spirit of Christ is given to every man, that they may  know good from evil; wherefore I shew unto you the way to judge: for every thing  which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth  by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge,  it is of God;</p> <p>7:17 but whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in  Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect  knowledge it is of the Devil, for after this manner doth the Devil work: for he  persuadeth no man to do good, no not one; neither doth his angels; neither doth  they which subject themselves unto him.</p> <p>7:18 And now my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may  judge, which is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully: for  with that same judgment which ye judge, ye shall also be judged.</p> <p>7:19 Wherefore I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should preach diligently  in the light of Christ, that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold  upon every good thing and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of  Christ.</p> <p>7:20 And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon every  good thing?</p> <p>7:21 And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will  tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing.</p> <p>7:22 For behold, God knowing all things, being from everlasting to  everlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children of men, to  make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in Christ there should come  every good thing.</p> <p>7:23 And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that Christ  should come.</p> <p>7:24 And behold, there were diverse ways that he did manifest things unto the  children of men, which were good; and all things which are good, cometh of  Christ, otherwise men were fallen, and there could no good things come unto  them.</p> <p>7:25 Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which  proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ;  and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing: and thus it were  until the coming of Christ.</p> <p>7:26 And after that he came, men also were saved by faith in his name; and by  faith, they become the sons of God. And as suredly as Christ liveth, he spake  these words unto our fathers, saying, Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father  in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it  shall be done unto you.</p> <p>7:27 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, hath miracles ceased, because that  Christ hath ascended into heaven, and hath set down on the right hand of God, to  claim the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men:</p> <p>7:28 for he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those that  hath faith in him; and they that have faith in him, will cleave unto every good  thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men; and he dwelleth  eternally in the heavens.</p> <p>7:29 And because that he hath done this, my beloved brethren, hath miracles  ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither hath angels ceased to minister unto  the children of men.</p> <p>7:30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word  of his command, shewing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind, in  every form of godliness.</p> <p>7:31 And the office of their ministry is, to call men unto repentance, and to  fulfil and do the work of the covenants of the Father which he hath made unto  the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring  the word of Christ unto the chosen vessel of the Lord, that they may bear  testimony of him;</p> <p>7:32 and by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men  may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts,  according to the power thereof: and after this manner bringeth to pass the  Father the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.</p> <p>7:33 And Christ hath said, if ye will have faith in me, ye shall have power  to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.</p> <p>7:34 And he hath said, Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and  be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved.</p> <p>7:35 And now my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are  true which I have spoken unto you, and God will shew unto you with power and  great glory at the last day, that they are true; and if they are true, hath the  day of miracles ceased?</p> <p>7:36 or hath angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? or hath he  withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? or will he, so long as time  shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face  thereof to be saved?</p> <p>7:37 Behold I say unto you Nay, for it is by faith that miracles are wrought;  and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore if these  things have ceased, wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of  unbelief, and all is vain:</p> <p>7:38 for no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they  shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, than has  faith ceased also; an awful is the state of man: for they are as though there  had been no redemption made.</p> <p>7:39 But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I  judge that ye have faith in Christ, because of your meekness: for if ye have not  both faith in him, then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his  church.</p> <p>7:40 And again my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope.  How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?</p> <p>7:41 And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you, That ye  shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his  resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal; and this because of your faith in  him according to the promise;</p> <p>7:42 wherefore, if a man have faith, he must needs have hope: for without  faith there cannot be any hope.</p> <p>7:43 And again: Behold I say unto you, That he cannot have faith and hope,  save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart:</p> <p>7:44 if so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God,  save the meek and lowly of heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and  confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus is the Christ, he must  needs have charity: for if he have not charity, he is nothing; wherefore he must  needs have charity.</p> <p>7:45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not  puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and  rejoiceth not into iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things,  believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things;</p> <p>7:46 wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing,  for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest  of all, for all things must fail;</p> <p>7:47 but charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and  whoso is found possessed of it, at the last day it shall be well with them.</p> <p>7:48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all energy of  heart, that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who  are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ, that ye may become the sons of God,  that when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is,  that we may have this hope, that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 8</p> <p>8:1 And epistle of my father Moron, written to me, Moroni; and it was written  unto me soon after my calling to the ministry. And on this wise did he write  unto me, saying:</p> <p>8:2 My beloved son Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ  hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his ministry, and to his holy  work.</p> <p>8:3 I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God  the Father, in the name of his holy child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite  goodness and grace, will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to  the end.</p> <p>8:4 And now my son, I speak unto you concerning that which grieveth me  exceedingly: for it grieveth me that there should disputations rise among you.</p> <p>8:5 For if I have learned the truth, there has been disputations among you  concerning the baptism of your little children.</p> <p>8:6 And now my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross  error should be removed from among you: for, for this intent I have written this  epistle.</p> <p>8:7 For immediately after I had learned these things of you, I inquired of  the Lord concerning this matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the  power of the Holy Ghost, saying,</p> <p>8:8 Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God.  Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous, but sinners to  repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore  little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore  the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath not power over them:  and the law of circumcision is done away in me.</p> <p>8:9 And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto  me; wherefore my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before God, that  ye should baptize little children.</p> <p>8:10 Behold, I say unto you, that this thing shall ye teach, repentance and  baptism unto they which are accountable and capable of committing sin; yea,  teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as  their little children, and they shall be saved with their little children;</p> <p>8:11 and their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold,  baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission  of sins.</p> <p>8:12 But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the  world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a  respector to persons: for how many little children have died without baptism.</p> <p>8:13 Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, they  must have gone to an endless hell.</p> <p>8:14 Behold I say unto you, That he that supposeth that little children  needeth baptism, is in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds iniquity: for he  hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in  the thought, he must go down to hell.</p> <p>8:15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because  of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no baptism. 8:16 Wo be  unto him that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they  shall perish, except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having  authority from God; and I fear not what man can do: for perfect love casteth out  all fear;</p> <p>8:17 and I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore all  children are alike unto me; wherefore I love little children with a perfect  love; and they are all alike, and partakers of salvation.</p> <p>8:18 For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being;  but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity.</p> <p>8:19 Little children cannot repent; wherefore it is awful wickedness to deny  the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because of his  mercy.</p> <p>8:20 And he that saith that little children needeth baptism, denieth the  mercies of Christ, and setteth at nought the atonement of him and the power of  his redemption.</p> <p>8:21 Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an endless  torment. I speak it boldly, God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give  heed, or they stand against you at the judgment seat of Christ.</p> <p>8:22 For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and also all  they that are without the law. For the power of redemption cometh on all they  that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no  condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing.</p> <p>8:23 But it is a mockery before God denying the mercies of Christ, and the  power of his holy spirit, and putting trust in dead works.</p> <p>8:24 Behold, my son, this thing had not ought to be: for repentance is unto  them that are under condemnation, and under the curse of a broken law.</p> <p>8:25 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by  faith, unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments  bringeth remission of sins;</p> <p>8:26 and the remission of sins bringeth mekness, and lowliness of heart; and  because of meekness, and lowliness of heart; cometh the visitation of the Holy  Ghost, which comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth  by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come when all the saints shall  dwell with God.</p> <p>8:27 Behold, my son, I will write unto you again, if I go not out soon  against the Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the  Nephites, hath proved their destruction, except they should repent.</p> <p>8:28 Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold, I  fear lest the spirit hath ceased striving with them; and in this part of the  land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority, which cometh  from God; and they are denying the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>8:29 And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must perish soon,  until the fulfilling of the prophecies which was spoken by the prophets, as well  as the words of our Saviour himself.</p> <p>8:30 Farewell, my son, until I write unto you, or shall meet you again. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>9:1 My beloved son, I write unto you again, that ye may know that I am yet  alive; but I write somewhat that which is grievous.</p> <p>9:2 For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in the which we  did conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram and Emron;  yea, and we have lost a great number of our choice men.</p> <p>9:3 And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall destroy this  people, for they do not repent, and Satan stireth them up continually to anger  one with another.</p> <p>9:4 Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word of  God with sharpness, they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no  sharpness, they harden their hearts against it; wherefore I fear lest the spirit  of the Lord hath ceased striving with them.</p> <p>9:5 For so exceedingly do they anger, that it seemeth me that they have no  fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards another; and they  thirst after blood and revenge continually.</p> <p>9:6 And now my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor  diligently: for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under  condemnation: for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay,  that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the  kingdom of God.</p> <p>9:7 And now I write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this people. For  according to the knowledge which I have received from Amoron, behold the  Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from the tower of Sherrizah; and  there were men, women, and children.</p> <p>9:8 And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they have slain;  and they feed the women upon the flesh of their husbands, and the children upon  the flesh of their fathers; and no water, save a little do they give unto them.</p> <p>9:9 And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites, it doth not  exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters of the  Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was  most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue;</p> <p>9:10 and after that they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most  cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after that they have  done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the  hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.</p> <p>9:11 O my beloved son, how can a people like this, that are without  civilization;</p> <p>9:12 (and only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and a  delightsome people;)</p> <p>9:13 but O my son, how can a people like this, whose delight is in so much  abomination,</p> <p>9:14 how can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment against us?</p> <p>9:15 Behold, my heart cries wo unto this people. Come out in judgment, O God,  and hide their sins, and wickedness, and abominations from before thy face.</p> <p>9:16 And again, my son, there are many widows and their daughters, which  remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which the Lamanites did not  carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has carried away, and left them to  wander whithersoever they can for food; and many old women do faint by the way  and die.</p> <p>9:17 And the army which is with me, is weak; and the armies of the Lamanites  are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the army of Aaron,  have fallen victims of their awful brutality.</p> <p>9:18 O the depravity of my people! they are without order and without mercy.  Behold, I am but a man, and I have but the strength of a man, and I cannot any  longer enforce my commands;</p> <p>9:19 and they have become strong in their perversion; and they are alike  brutal, sparing none, neither old or young; and they delight in every thing save  that which is good; and the sufferings of our women and our children upon all  the face of this land, doth exceed every thing; yea, tongue cannot tell, neither  can it be written,</p> <p>9:20 And now my son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene. Behold, thou  knowest the wickedness of this people; thou knowest that they are without  principle and past feeling; and their wickedness doth exceed that of the  Lamanites.</p> <p>9:21 Behold, my son, I cannot recommend thee unto God, lest he should smite  me.</p> <p>9:22 But beold, my son, I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that  thou wilt be saved; and I pray unto God that he would spare thy life, to witness  the return of his people unto him, or their utter destruction: for I know that  they must perish, except they repent and return unto him; 9:23 and if they  perish, it will be like unto the Jaredites, because of the wilfulness of their  hearts, seeking for blood and revenge.</p> <p>9:24 And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our brethren are  dissented over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also dissent over unto  them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou art spared; and I shall  perish and not see thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon: for I have sacred  records that I would deliver up unto thee.</p> <p>9:25 My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have  written, grieve thee to weigh thee down unto death, but may Christ lift thee up,  and may his sufferings and death, and the shewing his body unto our fathers, and  his mercy and long suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life,  rest in your mind forever.</p> <p>9:26 And may the grace of God, the Father, whose throne is high in the  heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sitteth on the right hand of his power,  until all things shall become subject unto him, be, and abide with you forever.  Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 10</p> <p>10:1 Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my  brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they should know that more than four  hundred and twenty years has passed away, since the sign was given of the coming  of Christ.</p> <p>10:2 And I seal up these records after that I have spoken a few words by way  of exhortation unto you.</p> <p>10:3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it  be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful  the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam, even  down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your  hearts.</p> <p>10:4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would  ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not  true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith  in Christ, and he will manifest the truth in you, by the power of the Holy  Ghost; and by the power of the Holy Ghost,</p> <p>10:5 ye may know the truth of all things.</p> <p>10:6 And whatsoever thing is good, is just and true; wherefore, nothing that  is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.</p> <p>10:7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I  would exhort you, that ye deny not the power of God: for he worketh by power  according to the faith of the children of men, the same to-day, and to-morrow,  and forever.</p> <p>10:8 And again I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God,  for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways  that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God which worketh all in  all: and they are given by the manifestations of the spirit of God unto men, to  profit them.</p> <p>10:9 For behold, to one is given by the spirit of God, that he may teach the  word of wisdom;</p> <p>10:10 and to another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same  spirit;</p> <p>10:11 and to another, exceeding great faith; and to another, the gifts of  healing by the same spirit.</p> <p>10:12 And again, to another, that he may work mighty miracles;</p> <p>10:13 and again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things;</p> <p>10:14 and again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits;</p> <p>10:15 and again, to another, all kinds of tongues;</p> <p>10:16 and again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of diverse  kinds of tongues.</p> <p>10:17 And all these gifts comes by the spirit of Christ; and they come unto  every man severally, according as he will.</p> <p>10:18 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that  every good gift cometh of Christ.</p> <p>10:19 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he  is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever, and that all these gifts which I  have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the  world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the children of men.</p> <p>10:20 Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith, there must  also be hope; and if there must be hope, there must also be charity;</p> <p>10:21 and except ye have charity ye can in no wise be saved in the kingdom of  God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God, if ye have not faith;  neither can ye, if ye have no hope;</p> <p>10:22 and if ye have no hope, ye must needs be in despair; and despair cometh  because of iniquity.</p> <p>10:23 And Christ truly said unto our fathers, If ye have faith, ye can do all  things which is expedient unto me.</p> <p>10:24 And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth, that if the day cometh  that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be  because of unbelief.</p> <p>10:25 And wo be unto the children of men, if this be the case: for there  shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among  you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God.</p> <p>10:26 And wo unto them which shall do these things away and die, for they die  in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it  according to the words of Christ, and I lie not.</p> <p>10:27 And I exhort you to remember these things: for the time speedily cometh  that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God: and  the Lord God will say unto you, Did I not declare my words unto you, which was  written by this man, like as one crying from the dead? yea, even as one speaking  out of the dust,</p> <p>10:28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And  behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and  his word shall hiss forth from generation to generation.</p> <p>10:29 And God shall shew unto you, that that which I have written, is true.</p> <p>10:30 And again I would exhort you, that ye would come unto Christ, and lay  hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.</p> <p>10:31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy  beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion, and strengthen thy stakes, and enlarge  thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants  of the Eternal Father, which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be  fulfilled.</p> <p>10:32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of  all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love  God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for  you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God  ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in no wise deny the power of God.</p> <p>10:33 And again, if ye, by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny  not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the  shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father, unto  the remission of your sins, that ye become holy without spot.</p> <p>10:34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of  God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth  triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great  Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
