    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1830 Book of Mormon<br />3 Nephi</strong></h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And Helaman was the son of Helaman, which was the son of Alma, which was the  son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi, which was the son of Lehi, which came  out of Jerusalem in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah.</p> <p>1:1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away; and  it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in  that year that Lachoneus was the Chief Judge and the governor over the land.</p> <p>1:2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla,  giving charge unto his son Nephi, which was his eldest son, concerning the  plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things  which had been kept sacred, from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem:</p> <p>1:3 then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth;  and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea, the record of this  people.</p> <p>1:4 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second  year, behold the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully;  for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the  people.</p> <p>1:5 But there were some which began to say, That the time was past for the  words to be fulfilled, which was spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</p> <p>1:6 And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying, the time is past,  and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore your joy and your faith  concerning this thing, hath been vain.</p> <p>1:7 And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the  land; and the people which believed, began to be very sorrowful, lest by any  means those things which had been spoken, might not come to pass.</p> <p>1:8 But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day, and that night, and  that day, which shall be as one day, as if there were no night, that they might  know that their faith had not been vain.</p> <p>1:9 Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers,  that all those who believed in those traditions, should be put to death, except  the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</p> <p>1:10 Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw the  wickedness of his people, his heart was exceeding sorrowful.</p> <p>1:11 And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the  earth, and cried mightly to his God, in behalf of his people; yea, those which  were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the traditions of their  fathers.</p> <p>1:12 And it came to pass that he cried mightly unto the Lord, all the day;  and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</p> <p>1:13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer: for behold, the time is at hand,  and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the  world, to shew unto the world that I will fulfil all that I have caused to be  spoken by the mouth of my Holy Prophets.</p> <p>1:14 Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known  unto the children of men, from the foundation of the world, and to do the will,  both of the Father, and the Son of the Father, because of me, and of the Son,  because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the  sign be given.</p> <p>1:15 And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi, was fulfilled,  according as they had been spoken: for behold, at the going down of the sun,  there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished, because there was  no darkness when the night came.</p> <p>1:16 And there were many which had not believed the words of the prophets,  fell to the earth, and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great  plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the word of  the prophets, had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already  at hand;</p> <p>1:17 and they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in  fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth, from the west to the  east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly  astonished, that they fell to the earth;</p> <p>1:18 for they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many  years, and that the sign which had been given, was already at hand; and they  began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</p> <p>1:19 And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it  was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise  in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was  the day that the Lord should be born, because of the signs which had been given.</p> <p>1:20 And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the  words of the prophets.</p> <p>1:21 And it came to pass also, that a new star did appear, according to the  word.</p> <p>1:22 And it came to pass that from this time forth, there began to be lyings  sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent  that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but  notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings, the more part of the people did  believe, and were converted unto the Lord.</p> <p>1:23 And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also  many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which, there were a great  remission of sins. And thus the people began to have peace in the land;</p> <p>1:24 and there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach,  endeavoring to prove by the Scriptures, that it was no more expedient to observe  the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the  Scriptures.</p> <p>1:25 But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced  of the error which they were in: for it was made known unto them that the law  was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the  word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot nor title  should not pass away, till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same  year, were they brought to a knowledge of their error, and did confess their  faults.</p> <p>1:26 And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings  unto the people because of the signs which had come to pass, according to the  words of the prophecy of all the Holy Prophets.</p> <p>1:27 And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in  peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, which dwelt in the mountains,  which did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret  places, that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many  murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.</p> <p>1:28 And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year, they began to  increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites  which did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites which  did remain in the land;</p> <p>1:29 and there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for  behold, they had many children which did grow up and began to wax strong in  years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some which were  Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton  robbers;</p> <p>1:30 and thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to  their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising  generation.</p> <p>2:1 And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also,  and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and  began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from Heaven, insomuch  that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began  to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen,</p> <p>2:2 imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men,  and by the power of the Devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the  people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again,  insomuch that he did blind their eyes, and lead them away to believe that the  doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.</p> <p>2:3 And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and  abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or  wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people.  tempting them and causing them that they should do great</p> <p>wickedness in the land.</p> <p>2:4 And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and  seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth  year;</p> <p>2:5 and also an hundred years had passed away, since the days of Mosiah,  which was the king over the people of the Nephites.</p> <p>2:6 And six hundred and nine years had passed away, since Lehi left  Jerusalem;</p> <p>2:7 and nine years had passed away, from the time which the sign was given,  which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.</p> <p>2:8 Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period which was  the sign given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed  away,</p> <p>2:9 and Nephi, which was the father of Nephi, which had the charge of the  records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could no where be found in  all the land.</p> <p>2:10 And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness,  notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them;  and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away  in iniquity.</p> <p>2:11 And it came to pass in the thirteenth year, there began to be wars and  contentions throughout all the land: for the Gadianton robbers had become so  numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities,  and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became  expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take  up arms against them;</p> <p>2:12 therefore all the Lamanites which had become converted unto the Lord,  did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety  of their lives, and their women and their children, to take up arms against  those Gadianton robbers; yea, and also maintain their rights, and their  privileges of their church, and of their worship, and their freedom, and their  liberty.</p> <p>2:13 And it came to pass that before the thirteenth year had passed away, the  Nephites were threatened with utter destruction, because of this war, which had  become exceeding sore.</p> <p>2:14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites which had united with the  Nephites, were numbered among the Nephites;</p> <p>2:15 and their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like  unto the Nephites;</p> <p>2:16 and their young men and their daughters became exceeding fair, and they  were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites. And thus ended the  thirteenth year.</p> <p>2:17 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war  between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue, and did become  exceeding sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the  robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the  mountains, and into their secret places.</p> <p>2:18 And thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the fifteenth year they did  come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the  people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissentions, the Gadianton  robbers did gain many advantages over them.</p> <p>2:19 And thus ended the fifteenth year; and thus were the people in a state  of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch  that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their  iniquity.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>3:1 And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of  Christ, Lachoneus, the Governor of the land, received an epistle from the  leaders and the Governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which  were written, saying:</p> <p>3:2 Lachoneus, most noble and Chief Governor of the land: behold I write this  epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceeding great praise because of your  firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye  suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were  supported by the hand of God, in the defence of your liberty, and your property,  and your country, or that which ye do call so.</p> <p>3:3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so  foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men,  which are at my command, which do now at this time stand in their arms, and do  await, with great anxiety, for the word, Go down upon the Nephites and destroy  them.</p> <p>3:4 And I knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the  field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you, because of  the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down  against you, they would visit you with utter destruction;</p> <p>3:5 therefore I have wrote this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand,  feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to  be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle;</p> <p>3:6 therefore I write unto you desiring that ye would yield up unto this my  people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they  should visit you with the sword, and that destruction should come upon you;</p> <p>3:7 or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us, and  become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren, that ye may be  like unto us; not our slaves, but our brethren, and partners of all our  substance.</p> <p>3:8 And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall  not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you, with an oath,  that on the morrow month, I will command that my armies shall come down against  you, and they shall not stay their hand, and shall spare not, but shall slay  you, and shall let fall the sword upon you, even until ye shall become extinct.</p> <p>3:9 And behold, I am Giddianhi, and I am the Governor of this secret society  of Gadianton; which society, and the works thereof, I know to be good; and they  are of ancient date, and they have been handed down unto us.</p> <p>3:10 And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will  deliver up your lands, and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that  this my people may recover their rights and government which have dissented away  from you, because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of  government; and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.</p> <p>3:11 And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle, he was  exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi, demanding the  possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people, and  avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had  wronged themselves, by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</p> <p>3:12 Now behold, this Lachoneus, the Governor, was a plain man, and could not  be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did  not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the Governor of the robbers, but he did  cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time  that the robbers should come down against them;</p> <p>3:13 yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should  gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds,  and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</p> <p>3:14 And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and  the strength thereof should be exceeding great. And he caused that there should  be armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all of them which  were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about, to  watch them, and to guard them from the robbers, day and night;</p> <p>3:15 yea, he said unto them, As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your  iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, that they would in no wise be delivered out  of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</p> <p>3:16 And so great and marvellous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus,  that they did cause fear to come upon all the people, and they did exert  themselves in their might, to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</p> <p>3:17 And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint Chief Captains over all  the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should  come down out of the wilderness against them.</p> <p>3:18 Now the chiefest among all the Captains, and the great Commander of all  the armies of the Nephites, was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</p> <p>3:19 Now it was the custom of all the Nephites, to appoint for their Chief  Captains, save it were in their times of wickedness, someone that had the spirit  of revelation, and also of prophecy; therefore this Gidgiddoni was a great  prophet among them, and also was the Chief Judge.</p> <p>3:20 Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni, Pray unto the Lord, and let us go  up upon the mountains, and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the  robbers and destroy them, in their own lands.</p> <p>3:21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them, the Lord forbid; for if we should go up  against them, the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will  prepare ourselves in the centre of our lands, and we will gather all out armies  together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come  against us; therefore, as the Lord liveth, if we do this, he will deliver them  into our hands.</p> <p>3:22 And it came to pass in the seventeenth year in the latter end of the  year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of  the land, and they had taken their horses and their chariots, and their cattle,  and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance,  and did march forth by thousands, and by the tens of thousands, until they had  all gone forth to the place which had been appointed, that they should gather  themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</p> <p>3:23 And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land  which was between the land of Zarahemla and the land Bountiful; yea, to the line  which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation;</p> <p>3:24 and there were a great many thousand people, which were called Nephites,  which did gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that  they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the  great curse which was upon the land northward;</p> <p>3:25 and they did fortify themselves against their enemies, and they did  dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been  spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they  did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in  the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</p> <p>3:26 And they were exceeding sorrowful because of their enemy. And Gidgiddoni  did cause that they should make weapons of war, of every kind, that they should  be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of  his instruction.</p> <p>4:1 And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year, those  armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down, and to sally  forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their  strong holds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the  lands, both which was in the land south, and which was in the land north, and  began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the  Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.</p> <p>4:2 But behold there was no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had  been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it  were in the wilderness.</p> <p>4:3 And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the  want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered  their flocks, and their herds, and all their substance, and they were in one  body;</p> <p>4:4 therefore there were no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain  food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the  Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved  for themselves provisions, and horses, and cattle, and flocks of every kind,  that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did  hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land. And thus the  eighteenth year did pass away.</p> <p>4:5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year, Giddianhi found that it  was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was  no way that they could subsist, save it were to plunder, and rob, and murder.</p> <p>4:6 And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land, insomuch  that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay  them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies, that in this year  they should go up to battle against the Nephites.</p> <p>4:7 And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the  sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to  battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a  lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood; and their heads were  shorn; and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the  appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of  their being dyed in blood.</p> <p>4:8 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the  appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift  their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them, and deliver them  out of the hands of their enemies.</p> <p>4:9 And it came to pass that when the armies of Gaddianhi saw this, they  began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy; for they had supposed  that the Nephites had fallen with fear, because of the terror of their armies;</p> <p>4:10 but in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear  them, but they did fear their God, and did supplicate him for protection;  therefore when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them, they were prepared to  meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them;</p> <p>4:11 and the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible  was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a  slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.</p> <p>4:12 And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had  made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from  before them.</p> <p>4:13 And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should  pursue them as far as to the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not  spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue  them, and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had  fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.</p> <p>4:14 And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with  boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting,  he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of Giddianhi, the robber.</p> <p>4:15 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to  their place of security. And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass  away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again  in the twentieth year;</p> <p>4:16 and in the twenty first year they did not come up to battle, but they  came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did  suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and  should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their  outward privileges, that they would cause them to yield themselves up according  to their wishes.</p> <p>4:17 Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was  Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah; that did cause that this siege should  take place.</p> <p>4:18 But behold this was an advantage unto the Nephites; for it was  impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have an effect upon  the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store</p> <p>4:19 because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold  they had nothing save it were meat for their substance, which meat they did  obtain in the wilderness. And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce  in the wilderness,</p> <p>4:20 insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger.</p> <p>4:21 And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by night, and  falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by ten  thousands.</p> <p>4:22 And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah, to withdraw  from their design, because of the great destruction which come upon them by  night and by day.</p> <p>4:23 And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people,  that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the  farthermost parts of the land, northward.</p> <p>4:24 And now Gidgiddoni, being aware of their design, and knowing their  weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been  made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night- time, and  did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of  their retreat;</p> <p>4:25 and this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond  the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they  were met by the armies of the Nephites, both in their front and in their rear.</p> <p>4:26 And the robbers which were on the south, were also cut off in their  place of retreat. And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.</p> <p>4:27 And there were many thousands which did yield themselves up prisoners  unto the Nephites; and the remainder of them were slain;</p> <p>4:28 and their leader Zemnarihah was taken, and hanged upon a tree, yea, even  upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had hanged him until he  was dead, they did fall the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice,  saying,</p> <p>4:29 May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of  heart, that they may cause to be fell to the earth all who shall seek to slay  them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been fell  to the earth.</p> <p>4:30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying, May the God  of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in  righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for  protection.</p> <p>4:31 And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing  and praising their God, for the great thing which he had done for them, in  preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies;</p> <p>4:32 yea, they did cry, Hosanna to the Most High God; and they did cry,  Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.</p> <p>4:33 And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many  tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands  of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their  humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.</p> <p>5:1 And now behold there was not a living soul among all the people of the  Nephites, which did doubt in the least thing in the words of all the holy  prophets which had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be  fulfilled;</p> <p>5:2 and they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of  the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and  because of the things which had come to pass already, they knew it must needs be  that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken;</p> <p>5:3 therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and  their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence, day and night.</p> <p>5:4 And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers  prisoners, insomuch that none did escape which were not slain, they did cast  their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto  them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that  they would murder no more, were set at liberty;</p> <p>5:5 but as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did  still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts; yea, as many as  were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren, were condemned and  punished according to the law.</p> <p>5:6 And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and  abominable combinations, in the which there were so much wickedness, and so many  murders committed.</p> <p>5:7 And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and  third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus  had twenty and five years passed away,</p> <p>5:8 and there had been many things transpired which, in the eyes of some,  would be great and marvellous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this  book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth part of what was done among  so many people in the space of twenty and five years;</p> <p>5:9 but behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this  people; and a more short but a true account was given by Nephi;</p> <p>5:10 therefore I have made my record of these things according to the record  of Nephi, which were engraven on the plates which were called the plates of  Nephi.</p> <p>5:11 And behold I do make the record on plates which I have made with mine  own hands.</p> <p>5:12 And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon,  the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people; yea, the first  church which was established among them after their transgression.</p> <p>5:13 Behold I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have been  called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have  everlasting life.</p> <p>5:14 And it hath become expedient that I according to the will of God, that  the prayers of those which have gone hence, which were the holy ones, should be  fulfilled according to their faith, should make a record of these things which  have been done;</p> <p>5:15 yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the time that  Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time;</p> <p>5:16 therefore I do make my record from the accounts which hath been given by  those which were before me, until the commencement of my day;</p> <p>5:17 and then I do make a record of the things which I have seen with mine  own eyes.</p> <p>5:18 And I know the record which I make to be a just and true record;  neverthelers there are many things which according to our language, we are not  able to write.</p> <p>5:19 And now I make an end of my sayings which is of myself, and proceed to  give my account of the things which hath been before me.</p> <p>5:20 I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my  God and my saviour Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of  Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those which he brought  out of that land,) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge  unto the salvation of our souls.</p> <p>5:21 Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto  the seed of Joseph.</p> <p>5:22 An insomuch as the children of Lehi hath kept his commandments, he hath  blessed them and prospered them according to his word;</p> <p>5:23 yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of Joseph to  the knowledge of the Lord their God;</p> <p>5:24 and as surely as the Lord liveth will he gather in from the four  quarters of the earth, all the remnant of the seed of Jacob, which was scattered  abroad upon all the face of the earth;</p> <p>5:25 and as he hath covenanted with all the house Jacob, even so shall the  covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob, be fulfilled in  his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge  of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them;</p> <p>5:26 and then shall they know their Redeemer, which is Jesus Christ, the Son  of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth,  unto their lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth,  so shall it be. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>6:1 And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to  their own lands, in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his  flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did  belong unto them.</p> <p>6:2 And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions;  therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their  grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious  things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on  the north, and on the south, both in the lands northward and on the land  southward.</p> <p>6:3 And they granted unto those robbers which had entered into a covenant to  keep the peace, of the band which were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands,  according to their numbers, that they might have with their labors, wherewith to  subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.</p> <p>6:4 And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and  sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and  they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</p> <p>6:5 And now there was nothing in all the land, to hinder the people from  prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</p> <p>6:6 And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the Judge Lachoneus, and those which had  been appointed leaders, which had established this great peace in the land.</p> <p>6:7 And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there  were many old cities repaired;</p> <p>6:8 and there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from  city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</p> <p>6:9 And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had  continual peace.</p> <p>6:10 But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year, there began to be some  disputings among the people; and some were lifted up in pride and boastings,  because of their exceeding great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions:</p> <p>6:11 for there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and  many officers.</p> <p>6:12 And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their  riches, and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their  poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches;</p> <p>6:13 some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceeding humble; some did  return railing for railing, while others would receive railing, and persecution,  and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were  humble and penitent before God;</p> <p>6:14 and thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that  the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the  church was broken up in all the land, save it were among a few of the Lamanites,  which were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for  they were firm, and steadfast, and immoveable, willing with all diligence to  keep the commandments of the Lord.</p> <p>6:15 Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this: Satan had great  power unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to  the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority,  and riches, and the vain things of the world.</p> <p>6:16 And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people, to do all manner  of iniquity; therefore they had not enjoyed peace but a few years.</p> <p>6:17 And thus in the commencement of the thirtieth year, the people having  been delivered up for the space of a long time, to be carried about by the  temptations of the Devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do  whatsoever iniquity he desired they should; and thus in the commencement of  this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.</p> <p>6:18 Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God  concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully  rebel against God.</p> <p>6:19 And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus: for  Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father, and did govern the people that year.</p> <p>6:20 And there began to be men inspired from heaven, and sent forth, standing  among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins  and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption  which the Lord would make for his people; or in other words, the resurrection of  Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.</p> <p>6:21 Now there were many of the people which were exceeding angry, because of  those which testified of these things; and those which were angry, were chiefly  the Chief Judges, and they which had been High Priests, and lawyers; yea, all  they which were lawyers, were angry with those which testified of these things.</p> <p>6:22 Now there was no lawyer, nor Judge, nor High Priest, that could have  power to condemn any one to death, save their condemnation was signed by the  governor of the land.</p> <p>6:23 Now there were many of those which testified of the things pertaining to  Christ, which testified boldly, which were taken and put to death secretly, by  the Judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the  land, until after their death.</p> <p>6:24 Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man  should be put to death, except they had power from the governor of the land;</p> <p>6:25 therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the  governor of the land, against these Judges which had condemned the prophets of  the land unto death, not according to the law.</p> <p>6:26 Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the  Judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to the law which  had been given by the people.</p> <p>6:27 Now it came to pass that those Judges had many friends and kindreds; and  the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the High Priests, did gather  themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of those Judges which were to  be tried according to the law;</p> <p>6:28 and they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that  covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and  administered by the Devil, to combine against all righteousness;</p> <p>6:29 therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter  into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those which were guilty of  murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according  to the law.</p> <p>6:30 And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country;  and they did covenant, one with another, to destroy the governor, and to  establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty, but  should be subject unto kings.</p> <p>7:1 Now behold, I will shew unto you that they did not establish a king over  the land; but in the same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon  the judgment seat, yea, did murder the Chief Judge of the land.</p> <p>7:2 And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate  one from another, into tribes, every man according to his family, and his  kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.</p> <p>7:3 And every tribe did appoint a Chief, or a leader over them; and thus they  became tribes, and leaders of tribes.</p> <p>7:4 Now behold, there was no man among them, save he had much family and many  kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceeding great.</p> <p>7:5 Now all this was done, and there was no wars as yet among them; and all  this iniquity had come upon the people, because they did yield themselves unto  the power of Satan;</p> <p>7:6 and the regulations of the government was destroyed, because of the  secret combinations of the friends and kindreds of them which murdered the  prophets.</p> <p>7:7 And they did cause great contention in the land, insomuch that the more  righteous part of the people, although they were nearly all become wicked; yea,  there were but few righteous men among them.</p> <p>7:8 And thus six years had not passed away, since the more part of the people  had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow  to her wallowing in the mire.</p> <p>7:9 Now this great combination which had brought so great iniquity upon the  people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom  they did call Jacob;</p> <p>7:10 and they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this  wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest which had given his voice against  the prophets which testified of Jesus.</p> <p>7:11 And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes  of the people which were united together, save it were their leaders did  establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were  enemies, notwithstanding they were not a righteous people; yet they were united  in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the  government;</p> <p>7:12 therefore Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they,  he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they  should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build  up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he  flattered them that there would be many dissenters,) and they become  sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people. And they did so;</p> <p>7:13 and so speedy was their march, that it could not be impeded, until they  had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth  year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</p> <p>7:14 And it came to pass in the thirty and first year, that they were divided  into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends;  nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one  with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of  government, for they were established according to the minds of them which was  their chiefs and their leaders. But they did establish very strict laws that one  tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had  peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their  God, and they did stone the prophets, and did cast them out from among them.</p> <p>7:15 And it came to pass that Nephi, having been visited by angels, and also  by the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being an eyewitness,  and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry  of Christ, and also being eyewitness to their quick return from righteousness  unto their wickedness and abominations;</p> <p>7:16 therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, and the  blindness of their minds, went forth among them in that same year, and began to  testify boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus  Christ.</p> <p>7:17 And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be  written, and a part of them would not suffice; therefore they are not written in  this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</p> <p>7:18 And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had  greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his  words; for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, that angels did  minister unto him daily;</p> <p>7:19 and in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and  even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and  suffered death by the people;</p> <p>7:20 and the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him,  because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the  people, in the name of Jesus.</p> <p>7:21 And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and  there were but few which were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were  converted, did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the  power and spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</p> <p>7:22 And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their  sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they  had been wrought upon by the spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did  shew forth signs also, and did do some miracles among the people.</p> <p>7:23 And it came to pass that thus passed away the thirty and second year  also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and  third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</p> <p>7:24 Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none which were  brought unto repentance, who were not baptized with water;</p> <p>7:25 therefore there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all  such as should come unto them, should be baptized with water, and this as a  witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented  and received a remission of their sins.</p> <p>7:26 And there were many in the commencement of this year, that were baptized  unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>8:1 And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our  record to be true: for behold, it was a just man which did keep the record; for  he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man which  could do a miracle in the name of Jesus, save he were cleansed every whit from  his iniquity.</p> <p>8:2 And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the  reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away,</p> <p>8:3 and the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which  had been given by the prophet Samuel, and Lamanite; yea, for the time that there  should be darkness for the space of three days, over the face of the land.</p> <p>8:4 And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the people,  notwithstanding so many signs had been given.</p> <p>8:5 And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, in  the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had  been known in all the land;</p> <p>8:6 and there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible  thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide  asunder;</p> <p>8:7 and there was exceeding sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in  all the land.</p> <p>8:8 And the city of Zarahemla did take fire;</p> <p>8:9 and the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the  inhabitants thereof were drowned;</p> <p>8:10 and the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the  place of the city thereof, there became a great mountain;</p> <p>8:11 and there was a great and terrible destruction in the land southward.</p> <p>8:12 But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land  northward: for behold, the whole face of the land changed, because of the  tempest, and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the  exceeding great quaking of the whole earth;</p> <p>8:13 and the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and  many smooth places became rough,</p> <p>8:14 and many great and noble cities were sunk, and many were burned, and  many were shook till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the  inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate;</p> <p>8:15 and there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was  exceeding great, and there were many in them which were slain;</p> <p>8:16 and there were some which were carried away in the whirlwind; and  whither they went, no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away;</p> <p>8:17 and thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the  tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.</p> <p>8:18 And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; yea, they were broken up upon  the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments,  and in seams, and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.</p> <p>8:19 And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and  the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease --for  behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by  some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible  things were done in about the space of three hours; and then behold, there was  darkness upon the face of the land.</p> <p>8:20 And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon the face of all  the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof which had not fallen, could feel  the vapour of darkness;</p> <p>8:21 and there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles,  neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and  exceeding dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;</p> <p>8:22 and there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the  sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the midst of darkness which  were upon the face of the land.</p> <p>8:23 And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days, that  there was no light seen; and there was great mourning, and howling, and weeping  among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people,  because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.</p> <p>8:24 And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented  before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been  spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.</p> <p>8:25 And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we  had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned  the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers, and our fair daughters,  and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great  city Moronihah; and thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.</p> <p>9:1 And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the  inhabitants of the earth upon all the face of this land, crying,</p> <p>9:2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth,  except they shall repent, for the Devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice,  because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is  because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen.</p> <p>9:3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and the  inhabitants thereof.</p> <p>9:4 And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused to be sunk in the depths  of the sea, and the inhabitants to be drowned.</p> <p>9:5 And behold, that great city Moronihah have I covered with earth, and the  inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before  my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come up any  more unto me against them.</p> <p>9:6 And behold, the city of Gilgal have I caused to be sunk, and the  inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the earth;</p> <p>9:7 yea, and the city Onihah, and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of  Mocum, and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Jerusalem, and the  inhabitants thereof, and waters have I caused to come up in the stead thereof,  to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of  the prophets and the saints shall not come up any more unto me against them.</p> <p>9:8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and the city  of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I caused to be sunk, and made  hills and valleys in the places thereof, and the inhabitants thereof have I  buried up in the depths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations  from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not  come up any more unto me against them.</p> <p>9:9 And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people  of the king of Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire, because of their  sins and their wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole  earth, because of their secret murders and combinations: for it was they that  did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I  did cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood  of the prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them.</p> <p>9:10 And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of  Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the  inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness in casting out the prophets,  and stoning them which I did send to declare unto them concerning their  wickedness and their abominations;</p> <p>9:11 and because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous  among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and  abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets  and the saints which I sent among them, might not cry unto me from the ground  against them;</p> <p>9:12 and many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and  upon this people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</p> <p>9:13 O all ye that are spared, because ye were more righteous than they! will  ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may  heal you?</p> <p>9:14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me, ye shall have  eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever  will come, him will I receive; and blessed are they which cometh unto me.</p> <p>9:15 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I created the Heavens and the  earth, and all things that in them is. I was with the Father from the beginning.  I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified  his name.</p> <p>9:16 I came unto my own, and my own received me not. And the scriptures,  concerning my coming are fulfilled.</p> <p>9:17 And as many as have received me, to them have I given to become the Sons  of God; and even so will I to as many as shall believe on my name: for behold,  by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of Moses fulfilled.</p> <p>9:18 I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the  beginning and the end.</p> <p>9:19 And ye shall offer up unto me the shedding of blood; yea, your  sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none  of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings;</p> <p>9:20 and ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite  spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him  will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because  of their faith in me, at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire  and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.</p> <p>9:21 Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world,  to save the world from sin;</p> <p>9:22 therefore whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will  I receive; for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down  my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends  of the earth, and be saved.</p> <p>10:1 And now behold it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear  these sayings, and did witness of it. And after these sayings there was a  silence in the land for the space of many hours;</p> <p>10:2 for so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease  lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain;  therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours.</p> <p>10:3 And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and  all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:</p> <p>10:4 O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, which are the  descendant of Jacob; yea, which are of the house of Israel; O ye people of the  house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens  under her wings, and have nourished you.</p> <p>10:5 And again, how oft would I have gathered you, as a hen gathereth her  chickens under her wings; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, which have  fallen; yea, ye people of the house of Israel; ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye  that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her  chickens, and ye would not.</p> <p>10:6 O ye house of Israel, whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a  hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me  with full purpose of heart.</p> <p>10:7 But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become  desolate, until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers.</p> <p>10:8 And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words,  behold they began to weep and howl again, because of the loss of their kindred  and friends.</p> <p>10:9 And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it was  in the morning and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the  earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful  groanings did cease, and all the tumultous noises did pass away,</p> <p>10:10 and the earth did cleave together again, that it stood, and the  mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people which were spared  alive, did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations  into the praise and the thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer:</p> <p>10:11 And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled, which had been spoken by  the prophets.</p> <p>10:12 And it was the more righteous part of the people which were saved, and  it was they which received the prophets, and stoned them not; and it was they  which had not shed the blood of the saints, which were spared;</p> <p>10:13 and they were spared, and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and  they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by  fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not  carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of  smoke and of darkness.</p> <p>10:14 And now whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures,  let him search them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by  fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by whirlwinds, and by the opening of  the earth to receive them, and all these things is not unto the fulfilling of  the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.</p> <p>10:15 Behold I say unto you yea, many have testified of these things at the  coming of Christ, and were slain because they testified of these things;</p> <p>10:16 yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock  spake concerning these things, because they testified particular concerning us,  which is the remnant of their seed.</p> <p>10:17 Behold our father Jacob also testified concerning a remnant of the seed  of Joseph. And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And those  things which testifies of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass  which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?</p> <p>10:18 And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth year,  behold I will shew unto you that the people of Nephi which were spared, and also  they which had been called Lamanites, which had been spared, did have great  favors shew unto them, and great blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch  that soon after the ascension of Christ into Heaven, he did truly manifest  himself unto them,</p> <p>10:19 shewing his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an account  of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore this time I make an end of  my sayings.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>11:1 And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered  together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land  Bountiful; and they were marvelling and wondering one with another, and were  shewing one to another the great and marvellous change which had taken place;</p> <p>11:2 and they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of which the sign  had been given, concerning his death.</p> <p>11:3 And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with  another, they heard a voice, as if it came out of Heaven; and they cast there  eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was  not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and  notwithstanding it being a small voice, it did pierce them that did hear, to the  centre, insomuch that there were no part of their frame that it did not cause to  quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to  burn.</p> <p>11:4 And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood  it not;</p> <p>11:5 and again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their  ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did  look steadfastly towards Heaven, from whence the sound came;</p> <p>11:6 and behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they  heard; and it saith unto them,</p> <p>11:7 Behold, my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have  glorified my name, hear ye him.</p> <p>11:8 And it came to pass as they understood, they cast their eyes up again  towards Heaven, and behold, they saw a man descending out of Heaven: and he was  clothed in a white robe, and he came down and stood in the midst of them, and  the eyes of the whole multitude was turned upon him, and they durst not open  their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant: for they thought  it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</p> <p>11:9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand, and spake unto the  people, saying:</p> <p>11:10 Behold I am Jesus Christ, of which the prophets testified that should  come into the world;</p> <p>11:11 and behold I am the light and the life of the world, and I have drank  out of the bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the  Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the  will of the Father in all things, from the beginning.</p> <p>11:12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words, the whole  multitude fell to the earth, for they remembered that it had been prophesied  among them that Christ should shew himself unto them after his ascension into  Heaven.</p> <p>11:13 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</p> <p>11:14 Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my  side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands, and in my  feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole  earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</p> <p>11:15 And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their  hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in  his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one, until they had all gone  forth, and did see with their eyes, and did feel with their hands, and did know  of a surety, and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the  prophets that should come.</p> <p>11:16 And it came to pass that when they had all gone forth, and had  witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</p> <p>11:17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall  down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</p> <p>11:18 And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi, (for Nephi was among the  multitude,) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</p> <p>11:19 And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord, and  he did kiss his feet.</p> <p>11:20 And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood  before him.</p> <p>11:21 And the Lord said unto him, I give unto you power that ye shall baptize  this people, when I am again ascended into heaven.</p> <p>11:22 And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he  gave unto them power to baptize. And he saith unto them, On this wise shall ye  baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</p> <p>11:23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your  words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize  them: Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye  baptize them.</p> <p>11:24 And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by  name, saying:</p> <p>11:25 Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of  the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p> <p>11:26 And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out  of the water.</p> <p>11:27 And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name, for behold, verily I  say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am  in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</p> <p>11:28 And according as I have commanded you, thus shall ye baptize. And there  shall be no disputations among you, as there hath hitherto been; neither shall  there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there  hath hitherto been;</p> <p>11:29 for verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of  contention, is not of me, but is of the Devil, which is the father of  contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with  another.</p> <p>11:30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with  anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be  done away.</p> <p>11:31 Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, I will declare unto you my  doctrine.</p> <p>11:32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath  given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of  me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me, and I bear record  that the father commandeth all men, every where to repent and believe in me;</p> <p>11:33 and whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved;  and they are they which shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p> <p>11:34 And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p> <p>11:35 Verily, verily I say unto you, that this is my doctrine; and I bear  record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me, believeth in the Father  also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me; for he will visit him with  fire, and with the Holy Ghost;</p> <p>11:36 and thus will the Father bear record of me: and the Holy Ghost will  bear record unto him of the Father and me: for the father, and I, and the Holy  Ghost, are one.</p> <p>11:37 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a child, and be  baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</p> <p>11:38 And again I say unto you, Ye must repent, and be baptized in my name,  and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</p> <p>11:39 Verily, verily I say unto you, that this is my doctrine; and whoso  buildeth upon this, buildeth upon my rock; and the gates of hell shall not  prevail against them.</p> <p>11:40 And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my  doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock, but he  buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell standeth open to receive  such when the floods come, and the winds beat upon them.</p> <p>11:41 Therefore go forth unto this people and declare the words which I have  spoken, unto the ends of the earth.</p> <p>12:1 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto Nephi,  and to those which had been called, (now the number of them which had been  called, and received power and authority to baptize, were twelve,) and behold he  stretched forth his hand unto the multitude, and cried unto them saying: Blessed  are ye, if ye shall give heed unto them saying, Blessed are ye, if ye shall give  heed unto the words of these twelve which I have chosen from among you to  minister unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have given power,  that they may baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized with water,  behold I will baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed  are ye, if ye shall believe in me, and be baptized, after that ye have seen me,  and know that I am.</p> <p>12:2 And again, more blessed are they which shall believe in your words,  because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am.  Yea, blessed are they which shall believe in your words, and come down into the  depths of humility, and be baptized; for they shall be visited with fire and  with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.</p> <p>12:3 Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit, which cometh unto me, for theirs is  the kingdom of Heaven.</p> <p>12:4 And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be comforted;</p> <p>12:5 and blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p> <p>12:6 And blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for  they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>12:7 And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</p> <p>12:8 And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p> <p>12:9 And blessed are all the peace-makers, for they shall be called the  children of God.</p> <p>12:10 And blessed are they which are persecuted, for my namesake, for theirs  is the kingdom of Heaven.</p> <p>12:11 And blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute, and shall  say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake,</p> <p>12:12 for ye shall have great joy and be exceeding glad, for great shall be  your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before  you.</p> <p>12:13 Verily, verily I say unto you, I give unto you to be the salt of the  earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor, wherewith shall the earth be  salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and  to be trodden under the foot of men.</p> <p>12:14 Verily, verily I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light of this  people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</p> <p>12:15 Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay, but on a  candle-stick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house;</p> <p>12:16 therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see  your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</p> <p>12:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not  come to destroy but to fulfil:</p> <p>12:18 for verily I say unto you, one jot nor one tittle hath not passed away  from the law, but in me it hath all been fulfilled.</p> <p>12:19 And behold I have given unto you the law and the commandments of my  Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and  come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Behold, ye have the  commandments before you, and the law is fulfilled;</p> <p>12:20 therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for verily I say unto you, that  except ye shall keep my commandments, which I have commanded you at this time,  ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p> <p>12:21 Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, and it is  also written before you, that thou shalt not kill; and whosoever kill, shall be  in danger of the judgment of God.</p> <p>12:22 But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be  in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall  be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in  danger of hell fire;</p> <p>12:23 therefore, if ye shall come unto me, or shall desire to come unto me,  and rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,</p> <p>12:24 go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy brother,  and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you.</p> <p>12:25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him,  lest any time he shall get thee, and thou shalt be cast into prison.</p> <p>12:26 Verily, verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence,  until thou hast paid the uttermost senine. And while ye are in prison, can ye  pay even one senine? Verily, verily I say unto you, Nay.</p> <p>12:27 Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit  adultery;</p> <p>12:28 but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after  her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.</p> <p>12:29 Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these  things to enter into your heart:</p> <p>12:30 for it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these things,  wherein ye shall take up your cross, than that ye should be cast into hell.</p> <p>12:31 It hath been written, That whosoever shall put away his wife, let him  give her a writing of divorcement.</p> <p>12:32 Verily, verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,  saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoso  shall marry her who is divorced, committeth adultery.</p> <p>12:33 And again it is written, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt  perform unto the Lord thine oaths.</p> <p>12:34 But verily, verily I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven,  for it is God's throne;</p> <p>12:35 nor by the earth, for it his footstool;</p> <p>12:36 neither shalt thou swear by the head, because thou canst not make one  hair black or white;</p> <p>12:37 but let your communications be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever  cometh of more than these are evil.</p> <p>12:38 And behold, it is written, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</p> <p>12:39 But I say unto you, That ye shall not resist evil: but whosoever shall  smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p> <p>12:40 And if any man shall sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let  him have thy cloak also.</p> <p>12:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p> <p>12:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and to him that would borrow of thee,  turn thou not away.</p> <p>12:43 And behold, it is written also, That thou shalt love thy neighbor, and  hate thine enemy:</p> <p>12:44 but behold I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse  you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you  and persecute you,</p> <p>12:45 that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he  maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good;</p> <p>12:46 therefore those things which were of old time, which were under the law  in me, are all fulfilled.</p> <p>12:47 Old things are done away, and all things have become new;</p> <p>12:48 therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I your Father which  is in Heaven is perfect.</p> <p>13:1 Verily, verily I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor;  but take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise  ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</p> <p>13:2 Therefore, when ye shall do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before  you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may  have glory of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward.</p> <p>13:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand  doeth;</p> <p>13:4 that thine alms may be secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret,  himself shall reward thee openly.</p> <p>13:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not do as hypocrites: for they love to  pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corner of the streets, that they may  be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward.</p> <p>13:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast  shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which  seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p> <p>13:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen: for they  think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p> <p>13:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things  ye have need of before ye ask him.</p> <p>13:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven,  Hallowed be thy name.</p> <p>13:10 Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</p> <p>13:11 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p> <p>13:12 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p> <p>13:13 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p> <p>13:14 For, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also  forgive you:</p> <p>13:15 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father  forgive your trespasses.</p> <p>13:16 Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance:  for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily, I  say unto you, They have their reward.</p> <p>13:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</p> <p>13:18 that thou appear not unto men, to fast, but unto thy Father, which is  in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p> <p>13:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust  doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal:</p> <p>13:20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor  rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.</p> <p>13:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p> <p>13:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy  whole body shall be full of light.</p> <p>13:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If  therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p> <p>13:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love  the other. or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot  serve God and mammon.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>13:25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he  looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and saith unto them, Remember the  words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they which I have chosen to  minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your  life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye  shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</p> <p>13:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,  nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much  better than they?</p> <p>13:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p> <p>13:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field  how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;</p> <p>13:29 and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon, in all his glory, was not  arrayed like the one of these.</p> <p>13:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is,  and to- morrow is cast into the oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not  of little faith.</p> <p>13:31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we  drink? or, wherewithal shall he be clothed?</p> <p>13:32 For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p> <p>13:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all  these things shall be added unto you.</p> <p>13:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take  thought for the things of itself. Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.</p> <p>14:1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he  turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying,  Verily, verily I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p> <p>14:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what  measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p> <p>14:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but  considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p> <p>14:4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of  thine eye; and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</p> <p>14:5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then  shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote of thy brother's eye.</p> <p>14:6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls  before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend  you.</p> <p>14:7 Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and  it shall be opened unto you:</p> <p>14:8 for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and  to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</p> <p>14:9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him  a stone?</p> <p>14:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</p> <p>14:11 If ye then being evil knoweth how to give good gifts unto your  children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to  them that ask him?</p> <p>14:12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do  even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</p> <p>14:13 Enter ye in at the straight gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is  the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p> <p>14:14 because, straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth  unto life, and few there be that find it.</p> <p>14:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but  inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p> <p>14:16 Ye shall know them by their fruits: Do men gather grapes of thorns, or  figs of thistles?</p> <p>14:17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree  bringeth forth evil fruit.</p> <p>14:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring  forth good fruit.</p> <p>14:19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast  into the fire.</p> <p>14:20 Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.</p> <p>14:21 Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the  kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</p> <p>14:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in  thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in my name done many  wonderful works?</p> <p>14:23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye  that work iniquity.</p> <p>14:24 Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will  liken unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</p> <p>14:25 and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and  beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</p> <p>14:26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,  shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</p> <p>14:27 and the rain descended. and the floods came, and the winds blew, and  beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>15:1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he cast  his eyes round about on the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold, ye have  heard these things which I have taught before I ascended to my Father; therefore  whoso remembereth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, him will I raise up at  the last day.</p> <p>15:2 And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words, he perceived  that there were some among them which marvelled, and wondered what he would  concerning the law of Moses: for they understood not the saying, That old things  had passed away, and that all things had become knew.</p> <p>15:3 And he saith unto them, Marvel not that I said unto you, that old things  had passed away, and that all things had become new.</p> <p>15:4 Behold I say unto you, That the law is fulfilled that was given unto  Moses.</p> <p>15:5 Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he which covenanted with my  people Israel; therefore, the law in me is fulfilled: for I have come to fulfil  the law; therefore, it hath an end.</p> <p>15:6 Behold, I do not destroy the prophets: for as many as have not been  fulfilled in me, verily, I say unto you, shall all be fulfilled.</p> <p>15:7 And because I said unto you, That old things hath passed away, I do not  destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things which is to come.</p> <p>15:8 For behold, the covenant which I have made with my people, is not all  fulfilled; but the law which was given unto Moses, hath an end in me.</p> <p>15:9 Behold, I am the law, and the light: Look unto me, and endure to the  end, and ye shall live: for unto him that endureth to the end, will I give  eternal life.</p> <p>15:10 Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore keep my  commandments. And this is the law and the prophets: for they truly testified of  me.</p> <p>15:11 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he said  unto those twelve whom he had chosen,</p> <p>15:12 Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, which are a  remnant of the house of Joseph.</p> <p>15:13 And behold, this is the land of your inheritance; and the Father hath  given it unto you.</p> <p>15:14 And not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should  tell it unto your brethren at Jerusalem;</p> <p>15:15 neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment, that I should  tell unto them concerning the other tribes of the house of Israel, which the  Father hath led away out of the land.</p> <p>15:16 This much did the Father command me, That I should tell unto them,</p> <p>15:17 that other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must  bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one  shepherd.</p> <p>15:18 And now because of stiffneckedness and unbelief, they understood not my  word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this  thing unto them.</p> <p>15:19 But, verily, I say unto you, that the Father hath commanded me, and I  tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their  iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity, that they know not of you.</p> <p>15:20 And verily, I say unto you again, That the other tribes hath the father  separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity, that they know not of  them.</p> <p>15:21 And verily, I say unto you, That ye are they of which I said, other  sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall  hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p> <p>15:22 And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles:  for they understood not that the Gentiles should be converted through their  preaching;</p> <p>15:23 and they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and  they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice;  that I should not manifest myself unto them, save it were by the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>15:24 But behold, ye have not heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my  sheep, and ye are numbered among them which the Father hath given me.</p> <p>16:1 And verily, verily, I say unto you, That I have other sheep, which are  not of this land; neither of the land of Jerusalem; neither in any parts of that  land round about, whither I have been to minister.</p> <p>16:2 For they of which I speak, are they which have not as yet heard my  voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them.</p> <p>16:3 But I have received a commandment of the Father, That I shall go unto  them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep,  that there may be one fold, and one shepherd; therefore I go to shew myself unto  them.</p> <p>16:4 And I command you that ye shall write these sayings, after that I am  gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they which have seen me, and  been with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name, that they may  receive a knowledge of you by the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes which  they know not of, that these sayings which ye shall write, shall be kept, and  shall be manifested unto the Gentiles, that through the fulness of the Gentiles,  the remnant of their seed which shall be scattered forth upon the face of the  earth, because of their unbelief, may be brought in, or may be brought to a  knowledge of me, their Redeemer.</p> <p>16:5 And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the earth; and  then will I fulfil the covenant which the Father hath made unto all the people  of the house of Israel.</p> <p>16:6 And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their belief in me, in and of  the Holy Ghost, which witness unto them of me and of the Father.</p> <p>16:7 Behold, because of their belief in me, saith the Father, and because of  the unbelief of you, O house of Israel, in the latter day shall the truth come  unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of these things shall be made known unto  them.</p> <p>16:8 But Wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles: for  notwithstanding that they come forth upon the face of this land, and have  scattered my people, which are of the house of Israel; and my people which are  of the house of Israel, have been cast out from among them, and have been  trodden under feet by them;</p> <p>16:9 and because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the  judgments of the Father upon my people, which are of the house of Israel,  verily, verily, I say unto you, That after all this, and I have caused my people  which are of the house of Israel, to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be  slain, and to be cast out from among them,</p> <p>16:10 and to become hated by them. And thus commandeth the Father that I  should say unto you at that day, When the Gentiles shall sin against my Gospel,  and shall reject the fulness of my Gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride  of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth,  and shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs,  and all manner of hypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and  of secret abominations; and if they shall do all these things and shall reject  the fulness of my Gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of  my Gospel from among them;</p> <p>16:11 and then will I remember my covenant which I have made unto my people,  O house of Israel, and I will bring my Gospel unto them;</p> <p>16:12 and I will shew unto thee, O house of Israel, that the Gentiles shall  not have power over you, but I will remember my covenant unto you, O house of  Israel, and ye shall come unto the knowledge of the fulness of my Gospel.</p> <p>16:13 But if the Gentiles will repent, and return unto me, saith the Father,  behold, they shall be numbered among my people, O house of Israel;</p> <p>16:14 and I will not suffer my people, which are of the house of Israel, to  go through among them, and tread them down, saith the Father.</p> <p>16:15 But if they will not turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, I will  suffer them, yea, I will suffer my people, O house of Israel, that they shall go  through among them, and shall tread them down, and they shall be as salt that  hath lost his savour, which is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out,  and to be trodden under foot of my people, O house of Israel.</p> <p>16:16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Thus has the Father commanded me, that  I should give unto this people this land for their inheritance.</p> <p>16:17 And when the words of the prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled, which  saith,</p> <p>16:18 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall  they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.</p> <p>16:19 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for  the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p> <p>16:20 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations:  and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God.</p> <p>Chapter 8</p> <p>17:1 Behold, bow it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he  looked round about again on the multitude, and he saith unto them, Behold, my  time is at hand.</p> <p>17:2 I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words  which I am commanded of the father to speak unto you at this time;</p> <p>17:3 therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I  have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand; and  prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again.</p> <p>17:4 But now I go unto the Father, and also to shew myself unto the lost  tribes of Israel: for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither  he hath taken them.</p> <p>17:5 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes  round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look  steadfastly upon him, as if they would ask him to tarry a little while longer  with them.</p> <p>17:6 And he saith unto them, Behold, my bowels is filled with compassion  towards you:</p> <p>17:7 Have ye any that are sick among you, bring them hither. Have ye any that  are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or  that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner, bring them hither, and I  will heal them: for I have compassion upon you; my bowels is filled with mercy:</p> <p>17:8 for I perceive that ye desire that I should shew unto you what I have  done unto your brethren at Jerusalem: for I see that your faith is sufficient,  that I should heal you.</p> <p>17:9 And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude,  with one accord, did go forth, with their sick, and their afflicted, and their  lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all that they were  afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought  forth unto him;</p> <p>17:10 and they did all, both they which had been healed, and they which were  whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for  the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with  their tears.</p> <p>17:11 And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should  be brought.</p> <p>17:12 So they brought their little children and sat them down upon the ground  round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till  they had all been brought unto him.</p> <p>17:13 And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus  stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon  the ground.</p> <p>17:14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus  groaned within himself, and saith, Father, I am troubled because of the  wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</p> <p>17:15 And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth;  and beheld he prayed unto the Father; and the things which he prayed, cannot be  written, and the multitude did bear record which heard him.</p> <p>17:16 And after this manner do they bear record; the eye hath never seen,  neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvellous things as we saw and  heard Jesus speak unto the Father;</p> <p>17:17 and no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man,  neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvellous things as we both  saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our  souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.</p> <p>17:18 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the  Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude, that they were  overcome.</p> <p>17:19 And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.</p> <p>17:20 And they arose from the earth, and he saith unto them, Blessed are ye  because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.</p> <p>17:21 And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bear  record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them,  and prayed unto the Father for them.</p> <p>17:22 And when he had done this he wept again,</p> <p>17:23 and he spake unto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold your  little ones.</p> <p>17:24 And as they looked to behold, they cast their eyes towards Heaven, and  they saw the Heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it  were, in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones  about; and they were encircled with fire; and the angels did minister unto them,</p> <p>17:25 and the multitude did see and hear, and bear record; and they know that  their record is true, for they all of them did see and hear, every man for  himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and  they did consist of men, women and children.</p> <p>18:1 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that they should  bring forth some bread and wine unto him.</p> <p>18:2 And while they were gone for the bread and wine, he commanded the  multitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth.</p> <p>18:3 And when the disciples had come with the bread and wine, he took of the  bread, and blessed it; and he gave unto the disciples, and commanded that they  should eat.</p> <p>18:4 And when they had eat, and were filled, he commanded that they should  give unto the multitude.</p> <p>18:5 And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he saith unto the  disciples, Behold, there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give  power that he shall break bread, and bless it, and give it unto the people of my  church, unto all they which shall believe and be baptized in my name.</p> <p>18:6 And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I  have broken bread, and blessed it, and gave it unto you.</p> <p>18:7 And this shall ye do in remembrance of my holy body, which I have shewn  unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father, that ye do always ways  remember me. And if ye do always remember me, ye shall have my spirit to be with  you.</p> <p>18:8 And it came to pass that when he had said these words, he commanded his  disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup, and drink of it, and  that they should also give unto the multitude, that they might drink of it.</p> <p>18:9 And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it, and were  filled; and they gave unto the multitude, and they did drink, and they were  filled.</p> <p>18:10 And when the disciples had done this, Jesus saith unto them, Blessed  are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my  commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do  that which I have commanded you.</p> <p>18:11 And this shall ye always do unto those who repent and are baptized in  my name; and ye shall do it in rememberance of my blood, which I have shed for  you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if  ye do always remember me, ye shall have my spirit to be with you.</p> <p>18:12 And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things. And if  ye shall always do these things, blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock.</p> <p>18:13 But whoso among you shall do more or less than these, are not built  upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends,  and the flood come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and  the gates of hell is already open to receive them;</p> <p>18:14 therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which the  Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.</p> <p>18:15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye  be tempted by the devil, and ye are led away captive by him.</p> <p>18:16 And as I have prayed among you, even so shall ye pray in my church,  among my people which do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the  light; I have set an example for you.</p> <p>18:17 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words unto his  disciples, he turned again unto the mnltitude, and saith unto them,</p> <p>18:18 Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always,  lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift  you as wheat;</p> <p>18:19 therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;</p> <p>18:20 and whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right,  believing that ye shall receive, and behold it shall be given unto you.</p> <p>18:21 Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your  wives and your children may be blessed.</p> <p>18:22 And behold, ye shall meet together oft, and ye shall not forbid any man  from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may  come unto you, and forbid them not;</p> <p>18:23 but ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so  be that they come unto you oft, ye shall pray for them unto the Father in my  name;</p> <p>18:24 therefore hold up your light, that it may shine unto the world. Behold  I am the light which ye shall hold up that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye  see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed;</p> <p>18:25 and ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but  rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see;  even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment,  suffereth himself to be lead into temptation.</p> <p>18:26 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he  turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had chosen, and saith unto  them,</p> <p>18:27 behold, verily, verily I say unto you, I give unto you another  commandment, and then I must go unto my Father, that I may fulfil other  commandments which he hath given me.</p> <p>18:28 And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye  shall not suffer any one knowingly, to partake of my flesh, and blood  unworthily, when ye shall minister it:</p> <p>18:29 For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily, eateth and  drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to  eat and drink of my flesh and blood, ye shall forbid him;</p> <p>18:30 nevertheless ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall  minister unto him, and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name, and if it  so be that he repenteth, and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him,  and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood;</p> <p>18:31 but if he repenteth not, he shall not be numbered among my people, that  he may not destroy my people: For behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered;</p> <p>18:32 nevertheless ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your  places of worship, for unto such shall ye minister; for ye know not but what  they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I  shall heal them, and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.</p> <p>18:33 Therefore keep these sayings which I have commanded you, that ye come  not under condemnation: For wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.</p> <p>18:34 And I give you these commandments, because of the disputations which  hath been among you beforetime. And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations  among you.</p> <p>18:35 And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I should go  unto the Father, for your sakes.</p> <p>18:36 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings,  he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even  until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them;</p> <p>18:37 and the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they  did not bear record; but the disciples bear record that he gave them power to  give the Holy Ghost. And I will shew unto you hereafter that this record is  true.</p> <p>18:38 And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a  cloud and overshadowed the multitude, that they could not see Jesus.</p> <p>18:39 And while they were overshadowed, he departed from them, and ascended  into Heaven. And the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again  into Heaven.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>19:1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into Heaven, the  multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his children, and  did return to his own home.</p> <p>19:2 And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was  dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them,  and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude;</p> <p>19:3 yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and  insomuch did they send forth unto the people, that there were many, yea, an  exceeding great number did labor exceedingly all night, that they might be on  the morrow in the place where Jesus should shew himself unto the multitude.</p> <p>19:4 And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was gathered  together, behold Nephi and his brother, whom he had raised from the dead, whose  name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and  Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon,  and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah: Now these were the names of the disciples  whom Jesus had chosen. And it came to pass that they went forth and stood in the  midst of the multitude.</p> <p>19:5 And behold, the multitude was so great, that they did cause that they  should be separated into twelve bodies.</p> <p>19:6 And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did cause that  the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the earth, and should pray unto  the Father, in the name of Jesus. And the disciples did pray unto the Father  also, in the name of Jesus.</p> <p>19:7 And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people.</p> <p>19:8 And when they had ministered those same words which Jesus had spoken  nothing varying from the words which Jesus had spoken behold, they knelt again,  and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus;</p> <p>19:9 and they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired  that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.</p> <p>19:10 And when they had thus prayed, they went down unto the water's edge,  and the multitude followed them.</p> <p>19:11 And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water, and was  baptized.</p> <p>19:12 And he baptized all they whom Jesus had chosen.</p> <p>19:13 And it came to pass when they were all baptized, and had come up out of  the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy  Ghost, and with fire.</p> <p>19:14 And behold, they were encircled about as if it were fire; and it came  down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and do bear record; and  angels did come down out of heaven, and did minister unto them.</p> <p>19:15 And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering unto the  disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and ministered unto them.</p> <p>19:16 And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and commanded  them that they should kneel down again upon the earth, and also that his  disciples should kneel down upon the earth.</p> <p>19:17 And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon the earth,  he commanded his disciples that they should pray.</p> <p>19:18 And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, calling  him their Lord and their God.</p> <p>19:19 And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and  went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he saith,</p> <p>19:20 Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these  whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me, that I have chosen  them out of the world.</p> <p>19:21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all of them  that shall believe in their words.</p> <p>19:22 Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost, because they believe in  me, and thou seest that they believe in me, because thou hearest them, and they  pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them.</p> <p>19:23 And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all they which  shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in them  as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one.</p> <p>19:24 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father,  he came unto his disciples, and behold they did still continue, without ceasing,  to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words, for it was given unto  them what they should pray, and they were filled with desire.</p> <p>19:25 And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them, as they did pray unto him,  and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his countenance did  shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the countenance, and also the  garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the  whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon the earth so white as the  whiteness thereof.</p> <p>19:26 And Jesus saith unto them, Pray on, nevertheless they did not cease to  pray.</p> <p>19:27 And he turned from them again, and went a little way off, and bowed  himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying:</p> <p>19:28 Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those which I have chosen,  because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them which shall  believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their  words, even as they are purified in me.</p> <p>19:29 Father, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given  unto me out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be purified in  me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I  may be glorified in them.</p> <p>19:30 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words, he came  again unto his disciples, and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing  unto him; and he did smile upon then again; and behold they were white, even as  Jesus.</p> <p>19:31 And it came to pass that he went again a little way off, and prayed  unto the Father;</p> <p>19:32 and tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither can be  written by man the words which he prayed.</p> <p>19:33 And the multitude did hear, and do bear record, and their hearts were  open, and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.</p> <p>19:34 Nevertheless, so great and marvellous were the words which he prayed,  that they cannot be written, neither can they be utttered by man.</p> <p>19:35 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying, he came  again to the disciples, and saith unto them, So great faith have I never seen  among all the Jews; wherefore I could not shew unto them so great miracles,  because of their unbelief.</p> <p>19:36 Verily I say unto you, there are none of them that have seen so great  things as ye have seen; neither have they heard so great things as ye have  heard.</p> <p>20:1 And it came to pass that he commanded the multitude that they should  cease to pray, and also his disciples. And he commanded them that they should  not cease to pray in their hearts.</p> <p>20:2 And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon their  feet. And they arose up and stood upon their feet.</p> <p>20:3 And it came to pass that he break bread again, and blessed it, and gave  to the disciples to eat.</p> <p>20:4 And when they had eat, he commanded them that they should break bread,  and give unto the multitude.</p> <p>20:5 And when they had given unto the multitude, he also gave them wine to  drink, and commanded them that they should give unto the multitude.</p> <p>20:6 Now there had been no bread, neither wine, brought by the disciples,  neither by the multitude;</p> <p>20:7 but he truly gave unto them bread to eat, and also wine to drink;</p> <p>20:8 and he saith unto them, He that eateth this bread, eateth of my body to  their soul, and he that drinketh of this wine, drinketh of my blood to their  soul, and their soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled.</p> <p>20:9 Now when the multitude had all eat and drank, behold they were filled  with the spirit, and they did cry out with one voice, and gave glory to Jesus,  whom they both saw and heard.</p> <p>20:10 And it came to pass that when they had all given glory unto Jesus, he  saith unto them, Behold now I finish the commandment which the Father hath  commanded me concerning this people, which are a remnant of the house of Israel.</p> <p>20:11 Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said that when the words of  Isaiah should be fulfilled: Behold they are written, ye have them before you;  therefore search them.</p> <p>20:12 And verily, verily I say unto you, that when they shall be fulfilled,  then is the fulfilling of the covenant which the Father hath made unto his  people. O house of Israel,</p> <p>20:13 and then shall the remnants which shall be scattered abroad upon the  face of the earth, be gathered in from the east, and from the west, and from the  south, and from the north; and they shall be brought to the knowledge of the  Lord their God, who hath redeemed them.</p> <p>20:14 And the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you this land,  for your inheritance.</p> <p>20:15 And I say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not repent after the  blessing which they shall receive, after that they have scattered my people,</p> <p>20:16 then shall ye which are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go forth among  them; and ye shall be in the midst of them, which shall be many; and ye shall be  among them, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion among  the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through, both treadeth down and teareth in  pieces, and none can deliver.</p> <p>20:17 Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine  enemies shall be cut off.</p> <p>20:18 And I will gather my people together, as a man gathereth his sheaves  into the floor:</p> <p>20:19 for I will make my people with whom the Father hath covenanted, yea, I  will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoops brass. And thou shalt beat in  pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their  substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he which doeth it.</p> <p>20:20 And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, That the sword of my  justice shalt hang over them at that day; and except they repent, it shall fall  upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon all the nations of the Gentiles.</p> <p>20:21 And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of  Israel.</p> <p>20:22 And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the  fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your Father Jacob; and it shall be  a new Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people;  yea, even I will be in the midst of you.</p> <p>20:23 Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord  your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me: him shall ye hear in  all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that  every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be cut off from among the  people.</p> <p>20:24 Verily, I say unto you, Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel. and  those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have testified of me.</p> <p>20:25 And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the  house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your  fathers, saying: Unto Abraham, and in thy seed, shall all the kindreds of the  earth be blessed:</p> <p>20:26 the Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to bless  you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities; and this because ye  are the children of the covenant.</p> <p>20:27 And after that ye were blessed, then fulfilleth the Father the covenant  which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the  earth be blessed, unto the pouring out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the  Gentiles, which blessing upon the Gentiles, shall make them mighty above all,  unto the scattering of my people, O house of Israel;</p> <p>20:28 and they shall be scourge unto the people of this land. Nevertheless,  when they shall have received the fulness of my Gospel, then if they shall  harden their hearts against me, I will return their iniquities upon their heads,  saith the Father.</p> <p>20:29 And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people: and  I have covenanted with them, that I would gather them together in mine own due  time; that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers, for their  inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto  them forever, saith the Father.</p> <p>20:30 And it shall come to pass that the time cometh, when the fulness of my  gospel shall be preached unto them,</p> <p>20:31 and they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God,  and shall pray unto the Father in my name.</p> <p>20:32 Then shall their watchmen lift up their voice; and with the voice  together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye.</p> <p>20:33 Then will the Father gather them together again, and give unto them  Jerusalem for the land of their inheritance.</p> <p>20:34 Then shall they break forth into joy sing together, ye waste places of  Jerusalem: for the Father hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p> <p>20:35 The Father hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations:  and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of the Father; and the  Father and I are one.</p> <p>20:36 And then shall be brought to pass that which is writen: Awake, awake  again, and put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O  Jerusalem. the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the  uncircumcised and the unclean.</p> <p>20:37 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loose  thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive of Zion.</p> <p>20:38 For thus saith the Lord, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye  shall be redeemed without money.</p> <p>20:39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That my people shall know my name; yea,  in that day they shall know that I am he that doth speak.</p> <p>20:40 And then shall they say, How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet  of him that bringeth good tidings unto them, that publisheth peace; that  bringeth good tidings unto them of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith  unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p> <p>20:41 And then shall a cry go forth, Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from  thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye  clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.</p> <p>20:42 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the Lord will  go before you; and the God of Israel shall be your reward.</p> <p>20:43 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and  extolled, and be very high.</p> <p>20:44 As many were astonished at thee; (his visage was so marred more than  any man, and his form more than the sons of men:)</p> <p>20:45 so shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at  him: for that which had been told them shall they see; and that which they had  not heard shall they consider.</p> <p>20:46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, All these things shall surely come,  even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall this covenant which the Father  hath covenanted with his people, be fulfilled; and then shall Jerusalem be  inhabited again with my people: and it shall be the land of their inheritance.</p> <p>21:1 And verily, I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may know the  time when these things shall be about to take place, that I shall gather in from  their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and shall establish again  among them my Zion.</p> <p>21:2 And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a sign: for  verily, I say unto you, That when these things which I declare unto you  hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost, which shall be given  unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles, that they may  know concerning this people which are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and  concerning this my people which shall be scattered by them;</p> <p>21:3 verily, verily, I say unto you, When these things shall be made known  unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father from them unto you:</p> <p>21:4 for it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this  land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these  things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant  of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house  of Israel;</p> <p>21:5 therefore, when these works, and the works which shall be wrought among  you hereafter, shall come forth from the Gentiles unto your seed, which shall  dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity:</p> <p>21:6 for thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth from the  Gentiles, that he may shew forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this cause,  that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they may repent  and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and know of the true points of my  doctrine, that they may be numbered among my people, O house of Israel;</p> <p>21:7 and when these things come to pass, that thy seed shall begin to know  these things, it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of  the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he  hath made unto the people which are of the house of Israel.</p> <p>21:8 And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that kings shall  shut their mouths: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and  that which they had not heard shall they consider.</p> <p>21:9 For in that day, for my sake shall the Father work a work, which shall  be a great and a marvellous work among them; and there shall be among them which  will not believe it, although a man shall declare it unto them.</p> <p>21:10 But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand; therefore they  shall not hurt him, although he shall be marred because of them. Yet I will heal  him, for I will shew unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the  Devil.</p> <p>21:11 Therefore it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not believe in my  words, which am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause him to bring forth  unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power that he shall bring them forth  unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said,) they shall be cut off  from among my people which are of the covenant;</p> <p>21:12 and my people which are a remnant of Jacob, shall be among the  Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them, as a lion among the beasts of the forest,  as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who if he go through, both treadeth  down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</p> <p>21:13 Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries, and all their  enemies shall be cut off.</p> <p>21:14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles, except they repent: for it shall come to  pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the  midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots,</p> <p>21:15 and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy  strong holds;</p> <p>21:16 and I will cut off witchcarfts out of thy hand, and thou shalt have no  more soothsayers:</p> <p>21:17 thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy standing images out of  the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the works of thy hand;</p> <p>21:18 and I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I  destroy thy cities.</p> <p>21:19 And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and deceivings, and  envyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall be done away.</p> <p>21:20 For it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that at that day,  whosoever will not repent and come unto my beloved Son, them will I cut off from  among my people, O house of Israel;</p> <p>21:21 and I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon the  heathen, such as they have not heard.</p> <p>Chapter 10</p> <p>21:22 But if they will repent, and hearken unto my words, and harden not  their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they shall come in unto  the covenant, and be numbered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have  given this land for their inheritance,</p> <p>21:23 and they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob; and also, as  many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which  shall be called the New Jerusalem;</p> <p>21:24 and then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in,  which are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem.</p> <p>21:25 And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also  will be in the midst:</p> <p>21:26 and then shall the work of the Father commence, at that day even when  this Gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this people. Verily, I say  unto you, At that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the  dispersed of my people; yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the  Father hath led away out of Jerusalem.</p> <p>21:27 Yea, the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my people, with  the Father, to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may call  on the Father in my name;</p> <p>21:28 yea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father, among all  nations, in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the  land of their inheritance.</p> <p>21:29 And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall not go out in  haste, nor go by flight: for I will go before them, saith the Father, and I will  be their rereward.</p> <p>22:1 And then shall that which is written come to pass. Sing, O barren, thou  that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst  not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the  children of the married wife, saith the Lord.</p> <p>22:2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains  of thy inhabitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords. and strengthen thy stakes;</p> <p>22:3 for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy  seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p> <p>22:4 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded: for  thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth,  and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p> <p>22:5 For thy Maker, thy husband, The Lord of hosts is his name; and thy  Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p> <p>22:6 For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,  and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.</p> <p>22:7 For a small amount have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I  gather thee.</p> <p>22:8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with  everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.</p> <p>22:9 For this, the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the  waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would  not be wroth with thee.</p> <p>22:10 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my  kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my people be  removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</p> <p>22:11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! behold, I  will lay the stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</p> <p>22:12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and  all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p> <p>22:13 And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be  the peace of thy children.</p> <p>22:14 In righteousness thou shalt be established: thou shalt be far from  oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near  thee.</p> <p>22:15 Behold, they shall surely gather together against thee, not by me:  whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.</p> <p>22:16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire,  and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the  waster to destroy.</p> <p>22:17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue  that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the  heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith  the Lord.</p> <p>23:1 And now behold I say unto you, That ye had ought to search these things.  Yea, a commandment I give unto you, that ye search these things diligently: for  great is the words of Isaiah.</p> <p>23:2 For surely he spake as touching all things concerning my people which  are of the house of Israel; therefore it must needs be that he must speak also  to the Gentiles.</p> <p>23:3 And all things that he spake, hath been, and shall be, even according to  the words which he spake.</p> <p>23:4 Therefore give heed to my words: write the things which I have told you;  and according to the time and the will of the Father, they shall go forth unto  the Gentiles.</p> <p>23:5 And whosoever will hearken unto my words, and repenteth, and is  baptized, the same shall be saved. Search the prophets: for many there be that  testify of these things.</p> <p>23:6 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words, he saith  unto them again, after he had expounded all the Scriptures unto them which they  had received, he saith unto the, Behold, other Scriptures I would that ye should  write, that ye have not.</p> <p>23:7 And it came to pass that he said unto Nephi, Bring forth the record  which ye have kept.</p> <p>23:8 And when Nephi had brought forth the records, and laid them before him,  he cast his eyes upon them, and saith,</p> <p>23:9 Verily, I say unto you, I commanded my servant Samuel, the Lamanite,  that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should  glorify his name in me, that there were many saints which should arise from the  dead, and should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. And he saith  unto them, Were it not so?</p> <p>23:10 And his disciples answered him and said, Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy  according to thy words, and they were fulfilled.</p> <p>23:11 And Jesus saith unto them, How be it that ye have not written this  thing, that many saints did arise and appear unto many, and did minister unto  them?</p> <p>23:12 And it came to pass that Nephi remembered that this thing had not been  written.</p> <p>23:13 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that it should be written;  therefore it was written according as he commanded.</p> <p>Chapter 11</p> <p>23:14 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had expounded all the  Scriptures in one, which they had written, he commanded them that they should  teach the things which he had expounded unto them.</p> <p>24:1 And it came to pass that he commanded them that they should write the  words which the Father had given unto Malachi, which he should tell unto them.  And it came to pass that after they were written, he expounded them. And these  are the words which he did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the Father unto  Malachi: Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before  me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the  messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the  Lord of hosts.</p> <p>24:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he  appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap.</p> <p>24:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifyer of silver: and he shall  purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer  unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.</p> <p>24:4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the  Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</p> <p>24:5 And I will come near to you to judgment: and I will be a swift witness  against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers,  and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the  fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger, and fear not me, saith the Lord of  hosts.</p> <p>24:6 For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not  consumed.</p> <p>24:7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine  ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you,  saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</p> <p>24:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we  robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</p> <p>24:9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole  nation.</p> <p>24:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in  my house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open  you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be  room enough to receive it.</p> <p>24:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy  the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the  time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.</p> <p>24:12 And all the nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a  delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.</p> <p>24:13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What  have we spoken against thee?</p> <p>24:14 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what doth it profit that we  have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of  hosts?</p> <p>24:15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set  up; yea, them that tempt God are even delivered.</p> <p>24:16 Then they that fear the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord  hearkened, and heard: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them  that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</p> <p>24:17 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I  make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that  serveth him.</p> <p>24:18 Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked,  between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</p> <p>25:1 For behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the  proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh  shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither  root nor branch.</p> <p>25:2 But unto you that fear my name, shall the Son of righteousness arise  with healings in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves in the  stall.</p> <p>25:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the  soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.</p> <p>25:4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in  Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.</p> <p>25:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the  great and dreadful day of the Lord:</p> <p>25:6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the  heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a  curse.</p> <p>26:1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things, he  expounded them unto the multitude: and he did expound all things unto them, both  great and small.</p> <p>26:2 And he saith, These Scriptures which ye had not with you, the Father  commanded that I should give unto you: for it was wisdom in him that they should  be given unto future generations.</p> <p>26:3 And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time  that he should come in his glory; yea, even all things which should come upon  the face of the earth, even until the elements should melt with fervent heat,  and the earth should be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the  earth should pass away;</p> <p>26:4 and even unto the great and last day, when all the people, and all  kindreds, and all nations and tongues shall stand before God, to be judged of  their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil:</p> <p>26:5 if they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be  evil, to the resurrection of damnation, being on a parallel, the one on the one  hand, and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the justice,  and the holiness which is in Christ, which was before the world began.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p> <p>26:6 And now there cannot be written in this book, even a hundredth part of  the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people;</p> <p>26:7 but behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things  which he taught the people;</p> <p>26:8 and these things have I written, which are a lesser part of the things  which he taught the people; and I have wrote them to the intent that they may be  brought again unto this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which  Jesus hath spoken.</p> <p>26:9 And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that they  should have first, to try their faith: And if it shall so be that they shall  believe these things, then shall the greater things be made manifest unto them.</p> <p>26:10 And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the  greater things be withheld from them, unto their condemnation.</p> <p>26:11 Behold I were about to write them all which were engraven upon the  plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbid it, saying, I will try the faith of my  people;</p> <p>26:12 therefore I, Mormon, do write the things which have been commanded me  of the Lord. And now I Mormon, make an end of my sayings, and proceed to write  the things which have been commanded me;</p> <p>26:13 therefore I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach  the people, for the space of three days; and after that, he did shew himself  unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and gave it unto them.</p> <p>26:14 And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the children of  the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did loose their tongues, and they  did speak unto their fathers great and marvellous things, even greater than he  had revealed unto the people, and loosed their tongues that they could utter.</p> <p>26:15 And it came to pass that after he had ascended into Heaven the second  time that he shewed himself unto them, and gone unto the Father, after having  healed all their sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of their blind, and  unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among  them, and raised a man from the dead, and had shewn forth his power unto them,  and had ascended unto the Father,</p> <p>26:16 behold, it came to pass on the morrow, that the multitude gathered  themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes  did open their mouths, and utter marvellous things; and the things which they  did utter were forbidden, that there should not any man write them.</p> <p>26:17 And it came to pass that the disciples whom Jesus had chosen, began  from that time forth to baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and  as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus, were filled with the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>26:18 And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful  to be written;</p> <p>26:19 and they taught, and did minister one to another; and they had all  things common among them, every man dealing justly, one with another.</p> <p>26:20 And it came to pass that they did do all things, even as Jesus had  commanded them.</p> <p>26:21 And they which were baptized in the name of Jesus, were called the  church of Christ.</p> <p>27:1 And it came to pass that as the disciples of Jesus were journeying, and  were preaching the things which they had both heard and seen, and were baptizing  in the name of Jesus, it came to pass that the disciples were gathered together,  and were united in mighty prayer and fasting.</p> <p>27:2 And Jesus again shewed himself unto them: for they were praying unto the  Father, in his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of them, and saith  unto them, What will ye that I shall give unto you?</p> <p>27:3 And they said unto him, Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name  whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people  concerning this matter.</p> <p>27:4 And the Lord said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, why is it  that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing?</p> <p>27:5 have they not read the scriptures, which saith ye must take upon you the  name of Christ, which is in my name? for by this name shall ye be called at the  last day;</p> <p>27:6 and whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same  shall be saved at the last day;</p> <p>27:7 therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore  ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my  name, that he will bless the church for my sake;</p> <p>27:8 and how be it my church, save it be called in my name? for if a church  be called in Moses' name, then it be Moses' church: or if it be called in the  name of a man, then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name,  then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my Gospel.</p> <p>27:9 Verily, I say unto you, that ye are built upon my Gospel; therefore ye  shall call whatsoever things ye do call in my name; therefore if ye call upon  the Father, for the church, if it be in my name, the Father will hear you;</p> <p>27:10 and if it so be that the church is built upon my Gospel, then will the  Father shew forth his own works in it;</p> <p>27:11 but if it be not built upon my Gospel, and is built upon the works of  men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you, they have joy in  their works for a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are hewn down  and cast into the fire, from whence there is no return;</p> <p>27:12 for their works do follow them: for it is because of their works that  they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that I have told you.</p> <p>27:13 Behold I have given unto you my Gospel, and this is the Gospel which I  have given unto you: That I came into the world to do the will of my Father,  because my Father sent me;</p> <p>27:14 and my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and  after that I have been lifted up upon the cross, I might draw all men unto me;  that as I have been lifted up by men, even so should men be lifted up by the  Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or  whether they be evil;</p> <p>27:15 and for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the  power of the Father, I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged  according to their works.</p> <p>27:16 And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my  name, shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold  guiltless before my Father, at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</p> <p>27:17 And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn  down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the  justice of the Father;</p> <p>27:18 and this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And  for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not,  but fulfilleth all his words;</p> <p>27:19 and no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing  entereth into his rest, save it be those who have washed their garments in my  blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their  faithfulness unto the end.</p> <p>27:20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come  unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception  of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</p> <p>27:21 Verily, verily I say unto you, this is my Gospel; and ye know the  things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do,  that shall ye also do; for the works which ye have seen me do, even that shall  ye do;</p> <p>27:22 therefore if ye do these things, blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted  up at the last day.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p> <p>27:23 Write the things which ye have seen and heard, save it be those which  are forbidden;</p> <p>27:24 write the works of this people, which shall be even as hath been  written of that which hath been;</p> <p>27:25 for behold, out of the books which have been written, and which shall  be written, shall this people be judged: for by them shall their works be known  unto men.</p> <p>27:26 And behold, all things are written by the Father; therefore out of the  books which shall be written shall the world be judged.</p> <p>27:27 And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the  judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just; therefore what manner  of men had ye ought to be? Verily I say unto you, Even as I am.</p> <p>27:28 And now I go unto the Father. And verily I say unto you, whatsoever  things ye shall ask the Father, in my name, it shall be given unto you;</p> <p>27:29 therefore ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto  you: for he that asketh, receiveth, and unto him that knocketh, it shall be  opened.</p> <p>27:30 And now behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because of you, and  also this generation; yea, and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the holy  angels, because of you and this generation: for none of them are lost.</p> <p>27:31 Behold, I would that ye should understand; for I mean them which are  now alive, of this generation; and none of them are lost; and in them I have  fulness of joy.</p> <p>27:32 But behold, it sorroweth me because of the fourth generation from this  generation, for they are led away captive by him, even as was the son of  perdition; for they will sell me for silver, and for gold, and for that which  moth doth corrupt, and which thieves can break through and steal. And in that  day will I visit them, even in turning their works upon their own heads.</p> <p>27:33 And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he saith  unto his disciples, Enter ye in at the straight gate: for straight is the gate,  and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it: But  wide is the gate, and broad the way which leads to death, and many there be that  traveleth therein, until the night cometh, wherein no man can work.</p> <p>28:1 And it came to pass when Jesus had said these words, he spake unto his  disciples, one by one, saying unto them, What is it that ye desire of me, after  I am gone to the Father?</p> <p>28:2 And they all spake, save it were three, saying, We desire that after we  have lived unto the age of man, that our ministry, wherein thou hast called us,  may have an end, that we may speedily come unto thee, in thy kingdom.</p> <p>28:3 And he saith unto them, Blessed are ye, because ye desired this thing of  me; therefore after that ye are seventy and two years old, ye shall come unto me  in my kingdom, and with me ye shall find rest.</p> <p>28:4 And when he spake unto them, he turned himself unto the three, and said  unto them, What will ye that I should do unto you, when I am gone unto the  Father?</p> <p>28:5 And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak unto him the  thing which they desired.</p> <p>28:6 And he saith unto them, Behold, I know your thoughts, and ye have  desired the thing which John, my beloved, which was with me in my ministry,  before that I was lifted up by the Jews, desired of me;</p> <p>28:7 therefore more blessed are ye, for ye shall never taste of death, but ye  shall live to behold all the doings of the Father, unto the children of men,  even until things shall be fulfilled, according to the will of the Father, when  I shall come in my glory, with the powers of heaven;</p> <p>28:8 and ye shall never endure the pains of death; but when I shall come in  my glory, ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, from mortality to  immortality; and then shall ye be blessed in the kingdom of my Father.</p> <p>28:9 And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh,  neither sorrow, save it be for the sins of the world; and all this will I do  because of the thing which ye have desired of me: for ye have desired that ye  might bring souls of men unto me, while the world shall stand;</p> <p>28:10 and for this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down  in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father  hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am; and I am even as the  Father; and the Father and I are one;</p> <p>28:11 and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and the Father  giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of men because of me.</p> <p>28:12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words, he touched  every one of them with his finger, save it were the three which were to tarry,  and then he departed.</p> <p>28:13 And behold, the heavens were opened, and they were caught up into  heaven, and saw and heard unspeakable things.</p> <p>28:14 And it was forbidden them that they should utter; neither was it given  unto them power that they could utter the things which they saw and heard;</p> <p>28:15 and whether they were in the body or out of the body, they could not  tell: for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration of them, that they were  changed from this body of flesh, into an immortal state, that they could behold  the things of God.</p> <p>28:16 But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the face of the  earth; nevertheless they did not minister of the things which they had heard and  seen, because of the commandment which was given them in heaven.</p> <p>28:17 And now whether they were mortal or immortal, from the day of their  transfiguration, I know not;</p> <p>28:18 but this much I know: According to the record which hath been given,  they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did minister unto all the  people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in their preaching;  baptizing them; and as many as were baptized, did receive the Holy Ghost;</p> <p>28:19 and they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to the  church. And the prisons could not hold them, for they were rent in twain,</p> <p>28:20 and they were cast down into the earth. But they did not smite the  earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they were delivered out  of the depths of the earth; and therefore they could not dig pits sufficiently  to hold them.</p> <p>28:21 And thrice they were cast into the furnace, and received no harm.</p> <p>28:22 And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts; and behold they did  play with the beasts, as a child with a sucking lamb, and received no harm.</p> <p>28:23 And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the people of  Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the  land: And they were converted unto the Lord, and were united unto the church of  Christ: And thus the people of that generation were blessed, according to the  word of Jesus.</p> <p>28:24 And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these things, for  a time.</p> <p>28:25 Behold, I were about to write the names of those who were never to  taste of death; but the Lord forbade, therefore I write them not, for they are  hid from the world.</p> <p>28:26 But behold I have seen them, and they have ministered unto me;</p> <p>28:27 and behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles knoweth  them not.</p> <p>28:28 They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them not.</p> <p>28:29 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom, that  they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all  nations, kindred, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus  many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and also because of the  convincing power of God which is in them,</p> <p>28:30 and they are as the angels of God and if they shall pray unto the  Father in the name of Jesus they can shew themselves unto whatsoever man it  seemeth them good;</p> <p>28:31 therefore great and marvellous works shall be wrought by them, before  the great and coming day, when all people must surely stand before the judgment  seat of Christ;</p> <p>28:32 yea, even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and marvellous work  wrought by them, before that judgment day.</p> <p>28:33 And if ye had all the scriptures which gives an account of all the  marvellous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words of Christ, know  that these things must surely come.</p> <p>28:34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of Jesus, and  also to them which he hath chosen and sent among them: for whoso receiveth not  the words of Jesus, and the words of them which he hath sent, receiveth not him;  and therefore he will not receive them at the last day;</p> <p>28:35 and it would be better for them of they had not been born. For do ye  suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God, who hath been  trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?</p> <p>28:36 And now behold, as I spake concerning them whom the Lord had chosen,  yea, even three which were caught up into the Heavens, that I knew not whether  they were cleansed from mortality to immortality:</p> <p>28:37 But behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and he hath  made it manifest unto me, that there must needs be a change wrought upon their  bodies, or else it needs be that they must taste of death;</p> <p>28:38 therefore that they might not taste of death, there was a change  wrought upon their bodies, that they might not suffer pain nor sorrow, save it  were for the sins of the world.</p> <p>28:39 Now this change was not equal to that which should take place at the  last day, but there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could  have no power over them, that he could not tempt them, and they were sanctified  in the flesh, that they were holy, and that the powers of the earth could not  hold them;</p> <p>28:40 and in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ;  and at that day they were to receive a greater change, and to be received into  the kingdom of the Father, to go no more out, but to dwell with God eternally in  the Heavens.</p> <p>29:1 And now behold, I say unto you, that when the Lord shall see fit, in his  wisdom, that these sayings shall come unto the Gentiles, according to his word,  then ye may know that the covenant which the Father hath made with the children  of Israel, concerning their restoration to the lands of their inheritance, is  already beginning to be fulfilled;</p> <p>29:2 and ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been spoken by  the holy prophets, shall be fulfilled; and ye need not say that the Lord delays  his coming unto the children of Israel;</p> <p>29:3 and ye need not imagine in your hearts, that the words which have been  spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord will remember his covenant which he hath  made unto his people of the house of Israel.</p> <p>29:4 And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you, then ye need  not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for the sword of his justice is  in his right hand, and behold at that day, if ye shall spurn at his doings, he  will cause it that it shall soon overtake you.</p> <p>29:5 Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto him  that shall deny the Christ, and his works;</p> <p>29:6 yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that  shall say, the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by  gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power of the Holy Ghost;</p> <p>29:7 yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, that there can be no  miracle wrought by Jesus Christ, for to get gain; for he that doeth this, shall  become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy, according to  the word of Christ.</p> <p>29:8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the  Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel, for behold the Lord  remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to that  which he hath sworn;</p> <p>29:9 therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the  Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment unto the fulfilling of the  covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p> <p>30:1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of  the living God, which he hath commanded me that I should speak concerning you:  for behold he commandeth me that I should write, saying,</p> <p>30:2 Turn all ye Gentiles from your wicked ways, and repent of your evil  doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your secret  abominations and your idolatries, and of your murders, and your priestcrafts,  and your envyings, and your strifes, and from all your wickedness and  abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive  a remission mission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may  be numbered with my people, which are of the house of Israel.</p>
