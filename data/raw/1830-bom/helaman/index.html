    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1830 Book of Mormon<br />Helaman</strong></h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An account of the Nephites. Their wars and contentions, and their  dissentions. And also the prophecies of many Holy Prophets, before the coming of  Christ, according to the record of Helaman, which was the son of Helaman, and  also according to the records of his sons, even down to the coming of Christ.  And also many of the Lamanites are converted. An account of their conversion. An  account of the righteousness of the Lamanites, and the wickedness and  abominations of the Nephites, according to the record of Helaman and his sons,  even down to the coming of Christ, which is called the Book of Helaman, &amp;c.</p> <p>1:1 And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year  of the reign of Judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious  difficulty among the people of the Nephites.</p> <p>1:2 For behold, Pahoran had died and gone all the way of all the earth;  therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the  judgment seat among the brethren, which were the sons of Pahoran.</p> <p>1:3 Now these are there names which did contend for the judgment seat, which  did also cause the people to contend; Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.</p> <p>1:4 Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran, (for he had many,) but these  are they which did contend for the judgment seat; therefore they did cause three  divisions among the people.</p> <p>1:5 Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of  the people to be a Chief Judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.</p> <p>1:6 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain  the judgment seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.</p> <p>1:7 But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that  he should be their governor, was exceeding wroth; therefore he was about to  flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.</p> <p>1:8 And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and  was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he  had raised up in rebellion, and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.</p> <p>1:9 Now when those people which were desirous that he should be their  governor, saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry; and  behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment seat of Pahoran, and  murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment seat.</p> <p>1:10 And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was  the flight of Kishkumen, that no man could overtake him.</p> <p>1:11 And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a  covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man  that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran;</p> <p>1:12 therefore Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was  in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen, and his band  which was covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a  manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found, were  condemned unto death.</p> <p>1:13 And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the  people, to be a Chief Judge and a govereor over the people, to reign in the  stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this  was done, in the fortieth year of the reign of the Judges; and it had an end.</p> <p>1:14 And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign of the  Judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable army of men, and  armed them with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and  with head-plates, and with breast-plates, and with all manner of shields of  every kind;</p> <p>1:15 and they came down again, that they might pitch battle against the  Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a  descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he  was a large and mighty man;</p> <p>1:16 therefore the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was  the son of Ammoron. Now Tubaloth supposing that Coriantumr, he being a mighty  man, could stand against the Nephites, insomuch with his strength, and also with  his great wisdom, that by sending him forth, he should gain power over the  Nephites;</p> <p>1:17 therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his  armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that  they should march down to the land of Zarahemla, to battle against the Nephites.</p> <p>1:18 And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much  difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the  land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not me into  the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.</p> <p>1:19 But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his  numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was  with such exceeding great speed, that there was no time for the Nephites to  gather together their armies;</p> <p>1:20 therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city,  and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every  one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole  city.</p> <p>1:21 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, which was the Chief Judge, did flee  before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it came to pass that  Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died. And thus ended  the days of Pacumeni.</p> <p>1:22 And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of  Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and  were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession  of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took courage, insomuch that he  was about to go forth against all the land.</p> <p>1:23 And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march  forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his  determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might  obtain the north parts of the land;</p> <p>1:24 and supposing that their greatest strength was in the centre of the  land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves  together, save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon  them and cut them down to the earth.</p> <p>1:25 But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the centre of the land,  gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the  numbers of the Nephites which were slain,</p> <p>1:26 for behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come  into the centre of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about  in the borders, as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that  their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.</p> <p>1:27 But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire,  but they had come into the centre of the land, and had taken the capital city,  which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital  parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women,  and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strong holds.</p> <p>1:28 But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi  with an army round about to head them, before they should come to the land  Bountiful:</p> <p>1:29 And thus he did; and he did head them, before they came to the land  Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back  towards the land of Zarahemla.</p> <p>1:30 And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and  did give unto them battle insomuch that it became an exceeding bloody battle;  yea, many were slain; and among the number which were slain, Coriantumr was also  found.</p> <p>1:31 And now behold the Lamanites could not retreat neither way; neither on  the north, nor on the south, nor the east, nor on the west, for they were  surrounded on every hand by the Nephites: And thus had Coriantumr plunged the  Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites,</p> <p>1:32 and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves into  the hands of the Nephites.</p> <p>1:33 And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city of  Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites which had been taken prisoners,  should depart out of the land in peace.</p> <p>1:34 And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>2:1 And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign of Judges,  after Moronihah had established again the peace betweem the Nephites and the  Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgment seat; therefore there  began to be a contention again among the people concerning w should fill the  judgment seat.</p> <p>2:2 And it came to pass that Helaman, which was the son of Helaman, was  appointed to fill the judgment seat, by the voice of the people;</p> <p>2:3 but behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy  Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, which had entered into a covenant  that no one should know his wickedness;</p> <p>2:4 for there was one Gadianton, who was exceeding expert in many words, and  also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and robbery; therefore  he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen;</p> <p>2:5 therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would  place him in the judgment seat, he would grant unto those which belonged to his  band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people;  therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.</p> <p>2:6 And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment seat, to  destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by  night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which  had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman.</p> <p>2:7 And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and gave unto him a sign;  therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that  he would conduct him to the judgment seat. that he might murder Helaman:</p> <p>2:8 And it came to pass that when the servant of Helaman had known all the  heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it  was the object of all those which belonged to his band, to murder, and to rob,  and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination,) the  servant of Helaman saith unto Kishkumen, Let us go forth unto the judgment seat.</p> <p>2:9 Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he  should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were  going forth, unto the judgment seat, did stab Kishkumen, even to the heart, that  he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which  he had seen, and heard, and done.</p> <p>2:10 And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of  robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.</p> <p>2:11 But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return, he  feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band  should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way,  into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them, they could  no where be found.</p> <p>2:12 And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the  forty and second year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.</p> <p>2:13 And behold, in the end of this book, ye shall see that this Gadianton  did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of  Nephi.</p> <p>2:14 But I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of  the Book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>3:1 And now it came to pass that in the forty and third year of the reign of  the Judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi, save it were a  little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissentions  among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and  third year.</p> <p>3:2 And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth  year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.</p> <p>3:3 And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there were much  contentions and many dissentions; in the which there were an exceeding great  many which departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land  northward, to inherit the land;</p> <p>3:4 and they did travel to an exceeding great distance, insomuch that they  came to large bodies of water, and many rivers;</p> <p>3:5 yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into  whatsoever parts it had not been rendered desolate, and without timber, because  of the many inhabitants which had before inherit the land.</p> <p>3:6 And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber, &amp;c.;  but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people which had before  inhabited the land, it was called desolate.</p> <p>3:7 And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless  the people which went forth, became exceeding expert in the working of cement;  therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.</p> <p>3:8 And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth  from the land southward, to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that  they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south, to the sea  north, from the see west, to the sea east.</p> <p>3:9 And the people which were in the land northward, did dwell in tents, and  in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon  the face of the land, that it should grow up, that in time they might have  timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their  synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings.</p> <p>3:10 And it came to pass as timber was exceeding scarce in the land  northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping;</p> <p>3:11 and thus they did enable the people in the land northward, that they  might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.</p> <p>3:12 And it came to pass that there were many of the people of Ammon, which  were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land.</p> <p>3:13 And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people,  by many of this people, which are particular and very large concerning them;</p> <p>3:14 but behold a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the  account of the Lamanites, and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions,  and dissentions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping,  and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues,  and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their  murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of  abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work;</p> <p>3:15 but behold, there are many books and records of every kind, and they  have been kept chiefly by the Nephites; and they have been handed down from one  generation to another, by the Nephites,</p> <p>3:16 even unto they have fallen into transgression, and have been murdered,  plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face  of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called  Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.</p> <p>3:17 And now I return again to mine account; therefore what I have spoken had  passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and  dissentions among the people of Nephi.</p> <p>3:18 The forty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges ended.</p> <p>3:19 And it came to pass that there was still great contentions in the land,  yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year;</p> <p>3:20 nevertheless, Helaman did fill the judgment seat with justice and  equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the  commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God,  continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did  prosper in the land.</p> <p>3:21 And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest the  name of Nephi, and unto the youngest the name of Lehi. And they began to grow up  unto the Lord.</p> <p>3:22 And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in a  small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty  and eighth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.</p> <p>3:23 And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of the  Judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the  secret combinations which Gadianton the nobler had established, in the more  settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those which  were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the  land.</p> <p>3:24 And it came to pass that in this same year, there was exceeding great  prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join  themselves unto the church, and were baptized unto repentance;</p> <p>3:25 and so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the  blessings, which were poured out upon the people, that even the High Priests and  the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.</p> <p>3:26 And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper, unto the  baptizing and uniting to the church of God many souls; yea, even tens of  thousands.</p> <p>3:27 Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the  sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name;</p> <p>3:28 yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those  who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, which is the son of God;</p> <p>3:29 yea, we see that whosoever will lay hold upon the word of God, which is  quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning, and the snares,  and the wiles of the Devil, and lead the man of Christ in a straight and narrow  course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the  wicked,</p> <p>3:30 and land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of  God, in the kingdom of Heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with  Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</p> <p>3:31 And in this year there were continual rejoicing in the land of  Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was  possessed by the Nephites.</p> <p>3:32 And it came to pass that there was peace, and exceeding great joy in the  remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace  and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>3:33 And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the Judges, there was  peace also save it were the pride which began to enter into the church; not into  the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to  the church of God;</p> <p>3:34 and they were lifted up in pride, even as to the persecution of many of  their brethren. Now this was a great evil, which did cause the humble part of  the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much afflictions;</p> <p>3:35 nevertheless, they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and  stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto  the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and  the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their  yielding their hearts unto God.</p> <p>3:36 And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also,  save it were the exceeding great pride which had got into the hearts of the  people; and it was because of their exceeding great riches, and their prosperity  in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.</p> <p>3:37 And it came to pass, in the fifty and third year of the reign of the  Judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And  it came to pass that he did fill the judgment seat with justice and equity; yea,  he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.</p> <p>4:1 And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year, there were many  dissentions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people,  insomuch that there was much bloodshed;</p> <p>4:2 and the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they  did go unto the king of the Lamanites.</p> <p>4:3 And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to  war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceeding fraid,  insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.</p> <p>4:4 But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the  Judges, there were dissenters which went up from the Nephites unto the  Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger  against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.</p> <p>4:5 And in t fifty and seventh year, they did come down against the Nephites  to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch, that in the  fifty and eighth year of the reign of the Judges, they succeeded in obtaining  possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the  land which was near the land Bountiful;</p> <p>4:6 and the Nephites, and the armies of Moronihah, were driven even into the  land of Bountiful;</p> <p>4:7 and there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the West Sea, even  unto the East; it being a day's journey for a Nephite, on the line which they  had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.</p> <p>4:8 And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous  army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was  in the land southward. And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth  year of the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>4:9 And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the Judges,  Moronihah did succeed with his armies, in obtaining many parts of the land; yea,  they retained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</p> <p>4:10 And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the reign of the  Judges, they succeeded in retaining even the half of all their possessions.</p> <p>4:11 Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was  among them, would not have happened, had it not been for their wickedness and  their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also which  professed to belong to the church of God;</p> <p>4:12 and it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their  exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor,  withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the  naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that  which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering,  plundering, lying, steeling, committing adultery, raising up in great  contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites;</p> <p>4:13 and because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their  own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not  prosper, but were afflicted, and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until  they had lost possession of almost all their lands.</p> <p>4:14 But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people, because of  their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, which were the sons of Helaman, did  preach many things unto the people; yea, and did prophesy many things unto them  concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not  repent of their sins.</p> <p>4:15 And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did  repent, they did begin to prosper;</p> <p>4:16 for when Moronihah saw that they did repent, he did venture to lead them  forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had retained  the one half of their property, and the one half of all their lands.</p> <p>4:17 And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>4:18 And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign of the  Judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites;</p> <p>4:19 therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their  lands, for so numerous was the Lamanites that it became impossible for the  Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his  armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.</p> <p>4:20 And it came to pass because of the greatness of the number of the  Lamanites, the Nephites were in great fear, lest they be overpowered, and  trodden down, and slain, and destroyed;</p> <p>4:21 yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the words  of Mosiah, and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that they  had set at nought the commandments of God;</p> <p>4:22 and that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of  Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and thus  seeing that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked  people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.</p> <p>4:23 And because of their iniquity, the church had began to dwindle; and they  began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy, and in the spirit of revelation;  and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.</p> <p>4:24 And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the  Lamanites, and that the spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it  had withdrawn from them, because the spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy  temples;</p> <p>4:25 therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and  matchless power, for they had fallen in a state of unbelief and awful  wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were more exceeding numerous than  they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God, they must  unavoidably perish.</p> <p>4:26 For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as  their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great  transgression, in the space of not many years.</p> <p>5:1 And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi delivered up  the judgment seat, to a man whose name was Cezoram.</p> <p>5:2 For as their laws and their governments were established by the voice of  the people, and they which chose evil were more numerous than they which chose  good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had been  corrupted;</p> <p>5:3 yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that  they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their  destruction.</p> <p>5:4 And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary, because of their  iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment seat, and took it upon him to preach  the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also, all  the remainder of his days:</p> <p>5:5 for they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them.  And these are the words which he spake:</p> <p>5:6 Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the  commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these  words: Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents, which came  out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done, that when you remember your  names, that ye may remember them; and when ye remember them, ye may remember  their works; and when ye remember their works, ye may know how that it is said,  and also written, that they were good;</p> <p>5:7 therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it  may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of  them.</p> <p>5:8 And now my sons, behold, I have somewhat more to desire of you , which  desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do  these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in Heaven, yea, which is  eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of  eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.</p> <p>5:9 O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto  his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can  be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, which shall come; yea,  remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</p> <p>5:10 And remember also, the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the  city of Ammonihah: for he said unto them, That the Lord surely should come to  redeem his people; but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but  to redeem them from their sins.</p> <p>5:11 And he hath power given unto him from the father, to redeem them from  their sins, because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare  the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of  the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.</p> <p>5:12 And now, my sons remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our  Redeemer, which is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation,  that when the Devil shall send forth his mighty winds; yea, h shafts in the  whirlwind; yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it  shall have no power over you, to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless  wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a  foundation whereon if men buildeth, they cannot fall.</p> <p>5:13 And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught his  sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many  things which are written.</p> <p>5:14 And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping  the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi,  beginning at the city Bountiful;</p> <p>5:15 and from thence forth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to  the city of Mulek;</p> <p>5:16 and even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all  the people of Nephi, which were in the land southward; and from thence into the  land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.</p> <p>5:17 And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that  they did confound many of those dissenters which had gone over from the  Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins, and were  baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites, to endeavor  to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.</p> <p>5:18 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites  with such great power and authority: for they had power and authority given unto  them that they might speak; and they also had what they should speak, given unto  them;</p> <p>5:19 therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites,  to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites  which were in the land of Zarahemla and round about, baptized unto repentance,  and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.</p> <p>5:20 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to  the land of Nephi.</p> <p>5:21 And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites,  and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his  brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.</p> <p>5:22 And after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold,  they went forth into the prison to take them, that they might slay them.</p> <p>5:23 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by  fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear, lest  they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they  were as standing in the midst of fire, and were not burned.</p> <p>5:24 And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire,  and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.</p> <p>5:25 For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them;  neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb  with amazement.</p> <p>5:26 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth, and began to  speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God that hath shewn unto  you this marvellous thing, in the which is shewn unto you, that ye cannot lay  your hands on us to slay us.</p> <p>5:27 And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook exceedingly,  and the walls of the prison did shake, as if they were about to tumble to the  earth; but behold, they did not fall. And behold, they that were in the prison,  were Lamanites, and Nephites which were dissenters.</p> <p>5:28 And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of  darkness, and an awful, solemn fear came upon them.</p> <p>5:29 And it came to pass that there came a voice, as if it were above the  cloud of darkness, saying, Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my  servants which I have sent unto you to declare the good tidings.</p> <p>5:30 And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was  not a voice of thunder; neither was it a voice of a great tumultous noise; but  behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,  and it did pierce even to the very soul.</p> <p>5:31 And notwithstanding the mildness the voice, behold, the earth shook  exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to  tumble to the earth; and behold, the cloud of darkness which had overshadowed  them, did not disperse.</p> <p>5:32 And behold, the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent, for the  kingdom of Heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants. And it  came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled;</p> <p>5:33 and also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them  marvellous words, which cannot be uttered by man: and the walls did tremble  again, and the earth shook as if it were about to divide asunder.</p> <p>5:34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee, because of the  cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable,  because of the fear which did come upon them.,</p> <p>5:35 Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once  belonged to the church of God, but had dissented from them.</p> <p>5:36 And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through  the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine  exceedingly, even as the face of angels. And he beheld that they did lift their  eyes to Heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their  voices to some being which they beheld.</p> <p>5:37 And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that they  might turn and look. And behold, there was power given unto them, that they did  turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi.</p> <p>5:38 And they said unto the man, Behold, what doth all these things mean? and  who is it with whom these men converse?</p> <p>5:39 Now the man's name was Aminadab. And Aminadab saith unto them, They do  converse with the angels of God.</p> <p>5:40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him, What shall we do,  that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?</p> <p>5:41 And Aminadab saith unto them, You must repent, and cry unto the voice,  even until ye shall have faith in Christ, which was taught unto you by Alma, and  Amulek, and by Zeesrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall  be removed from overshadowing you.</p> <p>5:42 And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice of him  which had shook the earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of darkness  was dispersed.</p> <p>5:43 And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw that  the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them, and behold, they  saw that they were encircled about, yea, every soul, by the pillar of fire.</p> <p>5:44 And Nephi and Lehi was in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled  about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them  not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled  with that joy which is unspeakable, and full of glory.</p> <p>5:45 And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from Heaven, and did  enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire; and they could  speak forth marvellous words.</p> <p>5:46 And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a pleasant  voice, as if it were a whisper, saying,</p> <p>5:47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my well beloved,  which was from the foundation of the world.</p> <p>5:48 And now when they heard this, they cast up their eyes as if to behold  from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels  came down out of heaven, and ministered unto them.</p> <p>5:49 And there were about three hundred souls which saw and heard these  things; and they were bid to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt.</p> <p>5:50 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto the  people, declaring throughout all the regions round about, all the things which  they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more part of the Lamanites were  convinced of them, because of the greatness of the evidencess which they had  received;</p> <p>5:51 as many as were convinced, did lay down their weapons of war, and also  their hatred, and the tradition of their fathers.</p> <p>5:52 And it came to ass that they did yield up unto the Nephites, the lands  of their possession.</p> <p>6:1 And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the reign of  the Judges had ended, all these things had happened, and the Lamanites had  become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their  righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness, and  their steadiness in faith.</p> <p>6:2 For behold, there were many of the Nephites which had become hardened,  and impenitent, and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of  god, and all the preaching and prophecying which did come among them.</p> <p>6:3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy, because of the  conversion of the Lamanites; yea, because of the church of God, which had been  established among them. And they did fellowship one with another, and did  rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.</p> <p>6:4 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down into the  land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner of  their conversion, and did exhort them to faith and repentance;</p> <p>6:5 yea, and many did preach with exceeding great power and authority, unto  the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be humble  followers of God and the Lamb.</p> <p>6:6 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land  northward; and also Nephi and Lehi went into the land northward, to preach unto  the people. And thus ended the sixty and third year.</p> <p>6:7 And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the Nephites  did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites  or the Lamanites.</p> <p>6:8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they  would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they  did have free intercourse one with another, for to buy and to sell, and to get  gain, according to their desire.</p> <p>6:9 And it came to pass that they became exceeding rich, both the Lamanites  and the Nephites; and they did have exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and  all manner of precious metals, both in the land south, and in the land north.</p> <p>6:10 Now the land south was called Lehi, and the land north was called Mulek,  which was after the sons of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the land  north, and Lehi into the land south.</p> <p>6:11 And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of  silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there was also curious workmen,  which did work all kinds of ore, and did refine it; and thus they did become  rich.</p> <p>6:12 They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south;  and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And they  did multiply and wax exceeding strong in the land . And they did raise flocks  and herds, yea, many fatlings.</p> <p>6:13 Behold, their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth,  of fine twined linen, and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness. And  thus the sixty and fourth year, did pass away in peace.</p> <p>6:14 And in the sixty and fifth year, they did also have great joy and peace;  yea, much preaching, and many prophecies concerning that which was to come. And  thus passed away the sixty and fifth year.</p> <p>6:15 And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth year of the reign of the  Judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand, as he sat upon the  judgment seat. And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, which  had been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered. And thus ended  the sixty and sixth year.</p> <p>6:16 And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year, the people began  to grow exceeding wicked again.</p> <p>6:17 For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of the  world, that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodsheds;  therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to  seek to get gain, that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they  began to commit secret murders, and to rob, and to plunder, that they might get  gain.</p> <p>6:18 And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band which had  been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it came to pass that there were  many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton's band. But behold, they were more  numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called  Gadianton's robbers and murderers;</p> <p>6:19 and it was they which did murder the Chief Judge Cezoram, and his son,  while in the judgment seat; and behold, they were not found.</p> <p>6:20 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were  robbers among them, they were exceeding sorrowful; and they did use every means  whatsoever was in their power, to destroy them off the face of the earth.</p> <p>6:21 But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more parts of the  Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did  enter into their covenants, and their oaths, that they would protect and  preserve one another, in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be  placed in, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings,  and their stealings.</p> <p>6:22 And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret  signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother  who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brothers  should do, he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong  to his band,</p> <p>6:23 and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms, and all manner of  wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country, and also the laws of their  God;</p> <p>6:24 and whosoever of those which belonged to their band, should reveal unto  the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not  according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their  wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.</p> <p>6:25 Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants, which Alma commanded  his sons should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of  bringing down the people unto destruction.</p> <p>6:26 Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto  Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they  were put into the heart of Gadianton, by that same being who did entice our  first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit;</p> <p>6:27 yea, the same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his  brother Abel, it should not be known unto the world.</p> <p>6:28 And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people,  to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to Heaven. And it was  that same being which led on the people which came from that tower, into this  land; which spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of  the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an  everlasting hell;</p> <p>6:29 yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton, to  still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he hath brought  it forth from the beginning of man, even down to this time.</p> <p>6:30 And behold, it is he which is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth  carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their  plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful  wickedness, from generation to generation, according as he can get hold upon the  hearts of the children of men.</p> <p>6:31 And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites;  yea, insomuch that they had become exceeding wicked; yea, the more part of them  had turned out of the way of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the  commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto  themselves idols of their gold and silver.</p> <p>6:32 And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them, in the  space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in  the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.</p> <p>6:33 And they did grow in their iniquities, n the sixty and eighth year also,  to the great sorrow and lamentations of the righteous.</p> <p>6:34 And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and  grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow  exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they began to keep his statutes  and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.</p> <p>6:35 And thus we see the spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the  Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.</p> <p>6:36 And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his spirit upon the  Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his word.</p> <p>6:37 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of  Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of  them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the  Lamanites.</p> <p>6:38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them  up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had  overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the  righteous, until they had come down to believe in their works, and partake of  their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.</p> <p>6:39 And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch  that they did trample under their feet, and smite, and rend, and turn their  backs upon the poor, and the meek, and humble followers of God.</p> <p>6:40 And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and ripening for an  everlasting destruction.</p> <p>6:41 And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the  reign of Judges over the people of Nephi.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>7:1 Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the reign of  the Judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman,  returned to the land of Zarahemla, from the land northward:</p> <p>7:2 for he had been forth among the people which was in the land northward,  and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto  them;</p> <p>7:3 and they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among  them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity;</p> <p>7:4 and seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those  Gadianton robbers filling the judgment seats; having usurped the power and  authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the  least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;</p> <p>7:5 condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the  guilty and the wicked go unpunished, bacause of their money; and moreover, to be  held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their  wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world; and moreover that they  might the more easy commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to  their own wills.</p> <p>7:6 Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not  many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his  breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul,</p> <p>7:7 O that I could have had my days, in the days when my father Nephi first  came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the  promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the  commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to  hearken unto the words of the Lord;</p> <p>7:8 yea, if my days could have been in them days, then would my soul have had  joy in the righteousness of my brethren.</p> <p>7:9 But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall  be filled with sorrow, because of this the wickedness of my brethren.</p> <p>7:10 And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in  the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market,  which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the  tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate  which led by the higway.</p> <p>7:11 A it came to pass that there was certain men passing by, and saw Nephi  as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower, and they ran and told  the people what they had seen; and the people came together in multitudes, that  they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.</p> <p>7:12 And now when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people which had  gathered together.</p> <p>7:13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them, Behold,  why have ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of your  iniquities?</p> <p>7:14 Yea, because I have got upon my tower, that I might pour out my soul  unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of  your iniquities?</p> <p>7:15 And because of my mourning and lamentation, ye have gathered yourselves  together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye had  ought to marvel, because ye are given away, that the Devil hath got so great  hold upon your hearts;</p> <p>7:16 yea, how could ye have given away to enticing of him, who art seeking to  hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?</p> <p>7:17 O repent ye, repent ye! why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye, unto the Lord  your God. Why hath he forsaken you?</p> <p>7:18 It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken  unto the voice of the good shepherd; ye have provoked him to anger against you.</p> <p>7:19 And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold he  shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for the dogs and wild beasts.</p> <p>7:20 O how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he hath  delivered you?</p> <p>7:21 But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men; yea, and that ye  might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the  vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal,  and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity;</p> <p>7:22 for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye  will not repent, behold this great city, and also all those great cities, which  are round about, which are in the land of our possessions, shall be taken away,  that ye shall have no place in them: For behold, the Lord will not grant unto  you strength, as he hath hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.</p> <p>7:23 For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not shew unto the wicked of my  strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their  sins, and hearken unto my words; now therefore I would that ye should behold, my  brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you, except ye  shall repent;</p> <p>7:24 for behold they are more righteous than you; for they have not sinned  against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be  merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their  seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed, except thou shalt repent;</p> <p>7:25 yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which hath come  among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band which  was established by Gadianton;</p> <p>7:26 yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have suffered  to enter your hearts, which hath lifted you up beyond that which is good because  of your exceeding great riches;</p> <p>7:27 yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations.</p> <p>7:28 And except ye repent, yes shall perish; yea even your lands shall be  taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</p> <p>7:29 Behold now I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because  it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these  things are true, because the Lord God hath made them known unto me; therefore I  testify that they shall be.</p> <p>8:1 And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold  there were men which were Judges, which also belonged to the secret band of  Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the  people, why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be  condemned according to the crime which he hath de?</p> <p>8:2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people, and  against our law?</p> <p>8:3 For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of  their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing  did he speak which were contrary to the commandments of God.</p> <p>8:4 And those Judges were angry with him because he spake plain unto them  concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless they durst not lay their  own hands upon him; for they feared the people, lest they should cry out against  them;</p> <p>8:5 therefore they did cry unto the people, saying, Why do ye suffer this man  to revile against us? For behold, he doth condemn all this people, even unto  destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us,  that we shall have no place in them.</p> <p>8:6 And now we know that this is impossible; for behold we are powerful, and  our cities great; therefore our enemies can have no power over us.</p> <p>8:7 And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger  against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some which did  cry out, Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he  saith will surely come to pass except we repent;</p> <p>8:8 yea, behold all the judgments will come upon us which he hath testified  unto us; for we know that he hath testified aright unto us concerning our  iniquities. And behold they are many; and he knoweth as well as all things which  shall befal us as he knoweth of our iniqities;</p> <p>8:9 yea, and behold if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified  concerning those things.</p> <p>8:10 And it came to pass that those people which sought to destroy Nephi,  were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him.  Therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in  the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.</p> <p>8:11 Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them, saying: Behold my  brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to  smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither,  insomuch that the Israelites, which were our fathers, came through upon dry  ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians, and swallowed  them up?</p> <p>8:12 And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye  dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I  may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?</p> <p>8:13 But behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words  which hath been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which was spoken by  this man, Moses, which had such great power given unto him; yea, the words which  he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.</p> <p>8:14 Yea, did he not bear record, that the Son of God should come? And as he  lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up  which should come.</p> <p>8:15 And as many as should look upon the serpent should live, even so as many  as should look upon the Son of God, with faith, having a contrite spirit, might  live, even unto that life which is eternal.</p> <p>8:16 And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all  the holy prophets, from his day even to the days of Abraham.</p> <p>8:17 Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with  gladness, and did rejoice.</p> <p>8:18 Yea, and behold I say unto you, That Abraham not only knew of these  things, but there were many before the days of Abraham which were called by the  order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be  shewn unto the people of a great many thousand years before his coming, that  even redemption should come unto them.</p> <p>8:19 And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of  Abraham, there hath been many prophets that hath testified these things; yea,  behold, the prophet Zenas did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.</p> <p>8:20 And behold, also Zenoch, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah,  (Jeremiah being that same prophet which testified of the destruction of  Jerusalem.) And now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed, according to the words  of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?</p> <p>8:21 And now will ye dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that  the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye  not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and that they were driven out  of the land of Jerusalem? But behold, this is not all.</p> <p>8:22 Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem, because he testified of  these things. Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our  fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of  Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.</p> <p>8:23 And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself  unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because  of that which is to come.</p> <p>8:24 And now seeing ye know these things, and cannot deny them, except ye  shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these  things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye  have received all things, both things in Heaven, and all things which are in the  earth, as a witness that they are true.</p> <p>8:25 But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy  God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treusures in  Heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean,  ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment;</p> <p>8:26 yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders, and  your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye  repent, it will come unto you soon;</p> <p>8:27 yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye unto the judgment  seat, and search; and behold, your Judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood;  and he ,hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment  seat.</p> <p>8:28 And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose author is  Gadianton, and the evil one which seeketh to destroy the souls of men.</p> <p>9:1 Behold now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words,  certain men which were among them ran to the judgment seat; yea, even there were  five which went; and they said among themselves, as they went,</p> <p>9:2 Behold, we will know of a surety, whether this man be a prophet, and God  hath commanded him to prophesy such marvellous things unto us. Behold we do not  believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless,  if this thing which he hath said concerning the Chief Judge be true, that he be  dead, then we will believe that the other words which he hath spoken is true.</p> <p>9:3 And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the  judgment seat; and behold the Chief Judge had fallen to the earth, and did lie  in his blood.</p> <p>9:4 And now behold, when they saw this, they were astonished exceedingly,  insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which  Nephi had spoken concerning the Chief Judge;</p> <p>9:5 but now when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them, lest all  the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people; therefore they  did quake, and had fallen to the earth.</p> <p>9:6 Now immediately when the Judge had been murdered: he being stabbed by his  brother, by a garb of secrecy; and he fled, and the servants ran and told the  people, raising the cry of murder among them.</p> <p>9:7 And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the place of  the judgment seat; and behold, to their astonishment, they saw those five men  which had fallen to the earth.</p> <p>9:8 And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the ,multitude which  had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among  themselves, These men are they which have murdered the Judge, and God hath  smitten them that they could not flee from us.</p> <p>9:9 And it came to pass that they laid ho on them, and bound them, and cast  them into prison. And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the Judge was  slain, and that the murderers had been taken, and was cast into prison.</p> <p>9:10 And it came to pass that on the morrow, the people did assemble  themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great and Chief  Judge, which had been slain.</p> <p>9:11 And thus were also those Judges which were at the garden of Nephi, and  heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.</p> <p>9:12 And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying, Where  are the five which was sent to inquire concerning the Chief Judge whether he was  dead? And they answered and said, Concerning this five which ye say ye have  sent, we know not; but there are five, which are the murderers, whom we have  cast into prison.</p> <p>9:13 And it came to pass that the Judges desired that they should be brought;  and they were brought, and behold they were the five which were sent; and behold  the Judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them  all that they had done, saying,</p> <p>9:14 We ran and came to the place of the judgment, and when we saw all  things, even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished, insomuch that we fell  to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast  us into prison.</p> <p>9:15 Now as for the murder of this man, we know not who hath done it, and  only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he  was dead according to the words of Nephi.</p> <p>9:16 And now it came to pass that the Judge did expound the matter unto the  people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying, Behold we know that this Nephi  must have agreed with some one to slay the Judge, and then he might declare it  unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to  be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet;</p> <p>9:17 and now behold we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault  and make known unto us the true murderer of this Judge.</p> <p>9:18 And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the  burial. Nevertheless, they did rebuke the Judges in the words which they had  spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they  did confound them.</p> <p>9:19 Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and  brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways,  that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death;</p> <p>9:20 saying unto him, Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done  this murder? Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault, saying, Behold here is  money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us and  acknowledge the agreement, which thou hast made with him.</p> <p>9:21 But Nephi saith unto them, O ye fools, ye uncircumsised of heart, ye  blind, and ye stiff-necked people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will  suffer you that ye shall go on this your ways of sin?</p> <p>9:22 O ye had ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great  destruction at this time which doth await you, except ye shall repent.</p> <p>9:23 Behold, ye say that I have agreed with a man, that he should murder  Seezoram, our Chief Judge. But behold, I say unto you, that this is because I  have testified unto you, that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for  a witness unto you, that I did know of the wickedness and abominations which is  among you.</p> <p>9:24 And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with a man that  he should do this thing; yea, because I shewed unto you this sign, ye are angry  with me, and seek to destroy my life.</p> <p>9:25 And now behold, I will shew unto you another sign, and see if ye will in  this thing seek to destroy me.</p> <p>9:26 Behold I say unto you, Go to the house of Seantum, which is the brother  of Seezoram, and say unto him,</p> <p>9:27 Hath Nephi, the pretended prophet, which doth prophesy so much evil  concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye have murdered  Seezoram, which is your brother?</p> <p>9:28 And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.</p> <p>9:29 And ye shall say unto him, Have ye murdered your brother?</p> <p>9:30 And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say. And behold, he  shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were astonished; nevertheless,  he shall declare unto you that he is innocent.</p> <p>9:31 But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall find blood upon the  skirts of his cloak.</p> <p>9:32 And when ye have seen this, ye shall say, From whence cometh this blood?  Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?</p> <p>9:33 And then he shall tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had  come upon him.</p> <p>9:34 And then shall ye say, Because of this fear and this paleness which hath  come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art guilty.</p> <p>9:35 And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he confess  unto you, and deny no more that he hath done this murder.</p> <p>9:36 And then shall he say unto you, That I, Nephi, know nothing concerning  the matter, save it were given unto me by the power of God. And then shall ye  know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto you from God.</p> <p>9:37 And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had  said unto them. And behold, the words which he had said, were true: for  according to the words, he did deny; and also according to the words, he did  confess.</p> <p>9:38 And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer,  insomuch that the five were set at liberty; and also was Nephi.</p> <p>9:39 And there were some of the Nephites which believed on the words of  Nephi; and there were some also, which believed, because of the testimony of the  five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.</p> <p>9:40 And now there were some among the people, which said that Nephi was a  prophet;</p> <p>9:41 and there were others which said, Behold, he is a god, for except he was  a god, he could not know of all things. For behold, he hath told us the thoughts  of our hearts, and also hath told us things; and even he hath brought unto our  knowledge the true murderer of our Chief Judge.</p> <p>10:1 And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people,  insomuch that they divided hither and thither, and went their ways, leaving  Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.</p> <p>10:2 And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house,  pondering upon the things which the Lord had shewn unto him.</p> <p>10:3 And it came to pass as he was pondering, being much cast down because of  the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness,  and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities and it  came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto  him, saying:</p> <p>10:4 Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done: for I  have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word which I have  given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not  sought thine own life, but hath sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</p> <p>10:5 And now because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I  will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in  faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according  to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</p> <p>10:6 Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in  the presence of mine angles, that ye shall have power over this people, and  shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction,  according to the wickedness of this people.</p> <p>10:7 Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth,  shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be  loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.</p> <p>10:8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple, It shall be rent in twain,  and it shall be done.</p> <p>10:9 And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become  smooth, and it shall be done.</p> <p>10:10 And behold, if ye shall say, That God shall smite this people, it shall  come to pass.</p> <p>10:11 And now behold, I command you that ye shall go and declare unto this  people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the almighty: Except ye repent, ye  shall be smitten, even unto destruction.</p> <p>10:12 And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these  words unto Nephi, he did stop, and did not go unto his house, but did return  unto the multitudes which were scattered about upon the face of the land, and  began to declare unto them the word of the Lord, which had been spoken unto him  concerning their destruction, if they did not repent.</p> <p>10:13 Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in  telling them concerning the death of the Chief Judge, they did harden their  hearts, and did not hearken unto the words of the Lord;</p> <p>10:14 therefore Nephi did declare unto them the words of the Lord, saying:  Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord: Ye shall be smitten even unto  destruction.</p> <p>10:15 And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word,  behold, they did still harden their hearts, and would not hearken unto his  words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands  upon him, that they might cast him into prison.</p> <p>10:16 But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him  to cast him into prison: for he was taken by the spirit, and conveyed out of the  midst of them.</p> <p>10:17 And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the spirit, from  multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it  unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.</p> <p>10:18 And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and  there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against  themselves, and began to slay one another with the sword.</p> <p>10:19 And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of Judges over  the people of Nephi.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>11:1 And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of  the Judges, that contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars  throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi.</p> <p>11:2 And it was this secret band of robbers which did carry on this work of  destruction and wickedness. And this war did last all that year. And in the  seventy and third year it did also last.</p> <p>11:3 And it came to pass that in this year, Nephi did cry unto the Lord,  saying:</p> <p>11:4 O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword;  but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in  remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto  thee;</p> <p>11:5 and so it was done, according to the words of Nephi. And there was a  great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi. And thus, in the  seventy and fourth year, the famine did continue, and the work of destruction  did cease by the sword, but became sore by famine.</p> <p>11:6 And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth  year. For the earth was smitten, that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain  in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the  Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did  perish by thousands, in the more wicked parts of the land.</p> <p>11:7 And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish  by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to  remember the words of Nephi.</p> <p>11:8 And the people began to plead with their Chief Judges and their leaders,  that they would say unto Nephi, Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and  therefore cry unto the Lord our God, that he turn away from us this famine, lest  all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction, be fulfilled.</p> <p>11:9 And it came to pass that the Judges did say unto Nephi, according to the  words which had been desired. And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the  people had repented, and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto  the Lord, saying:</p> <p>11:10 O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band  of Gadianton from amongst them, insomuch that they have become extinct, and they  have concealed their secret plans in the earth.</p> <p>11:11 Now, O Lord, because of this their humility, wilt thou turn away thine  anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men  whom thou hast already destroyed?</p> <p>11:12 O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and  cause that this famine may cease in this land?</p> <p>11:13 O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done  according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she  may bring forth her fruit and her grain, in the season of grain?</p> <p>11:14 O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a  famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt,  even at this time, hearken unto my words: for thou saidst, That if this people  repent, I will spare them;</p> <p>11:15 yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the  famine, and the pestilence and destruction which has come upon them.</p> <p>11:16 And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they  will serve thee? And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words  which thou hast said.</p> <p>11:17 And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year, the Lord did  turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the  earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit.  And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain, in the season of her  grain.</p> <p>11:18 And behold, the people did rejoice, and glorify God; and the whole face  of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy  Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having  great power and authority given unto him from God.</p> <p>11:19 And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things  pertaining to righteousness.</p> <p>11:20 And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper  again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to  multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of the land, both  on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west, to the sea east.</p> <p>11:21 And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace.  And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread  throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the  Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have  exceeding great peace in the land. And thus ended the seventy and seventh year.</p> <p>11:22 And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a  few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by  the prophets.</p> <p>11:23 And in the seventy and ninth year, there began to be much strife. But  it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren, which knew  concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore  they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put and end to their  strife in that same year.</p> <p>11:24 And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of the  Judges over the people of Nephi, there was a certain number of the dissenters  from the people of Nephi, which had some years before gone over unto the  Lamanites, and took upon themselves the name of Lamanites; and also, a certain  number which were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger  by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their  brethren.</p> <p>11:25 And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat  back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding  themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to  their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them;</p> <p>11:26 and thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became  an exceeding great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans  of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.</p> <p>11:27 Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great  destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the  Lamanites.</p> <p>11:28 And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop  put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into  the wilderness, and upon the mountains, to search out this band of robbers, and  to destroy them.</p> <p>11:29 But behold, it came to pass that in the same year, they were driven  back even into their own lands. And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign  of the Judges over the people of Nephi.</p> <p>11:30 And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year,  they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and  they were also visited with much destruction;</p> <p>11:31 and they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness, and out of  the mountains, unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the  numbers of those robbers which infested the mountains and the wilderness.</p> <p>11:32 And it came to pass that thus ended this year. And the robbers did  still increase and wax strong, inasmuch that they did defy the whole armies of  the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come  unto the people, upon all the face of the land,</p> <p>11:33 yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great  destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive  into the wilderness; yea, and more especially their women and their children.</p> <p>11:34 Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their  iniquity, did stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God.</p> <p>11:35 And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>11:36 And in the eighty and second year, they began again to forget the Lord  their God. And in the eighty and third year, they began to wax strong in  iniquity. And in the eighty and fourth year, they did not mend their ways.</p> <p>11:37 And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year, they did wax stronger  and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were  ripening again for destruction.</p> <p>11:38 And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.</p> <p>12:1 And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the  hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great  infinite goodness, doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him;</p> <p>12:2 yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people;  yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks, and their herds, and in  gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art;  sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies;  softening the hearts of their enemies, that they should not declare wars against  them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his  people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget  the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One; yea, and this  because of their ease, and their exceeding great prosperity.</p> <p>12:3 And thus we see, that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many  afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death, and with terror, and  with famine, and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</p> <p>12:4 O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devlish, and how quick to  do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to  hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain  things of the world;</p> <p>12:5 yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do  all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord  their God, and to give ear unto his counsels; yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's  path!</p> <p>12:6 Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created  them, should rule and reign over them, notwithstanding his great goodness and  his mercy towards them; they do set at nought his counsels, and they will not  that he should be their guide.</p> <p>12:7 O how great is the nothingness of the children of the men; yea, even  they are less than dust of the earth.</p> <p>12:8 For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, the  dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God;</p> <p>12:9 yea, behold, at his voice doth the hills and mountains tremble and  quake;</p> <p>12:10 and by the power of his voice, they are broken up and become smooth,  yea, even like unto a valley;</p> <p>12:11 yea, by the power of his voice, doth the whole earth shake;</p> <p>12:12 yea, by the power of his voice, doth the foundations rock, even to the  very centre;</p> <p>12:13 yea, and if he saith unto the earth, Move, and it is moved;</p> <p>12:14 yea, if he saith unto the earth, Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen  out the day for many hours, and it is done;</p> <p>12:15 and thus according to his word, the earth goeth back, and it appeareth  unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for sure it  is the earth that moveth, and not the sun.</p> <p>12:16 And behold, also, if he saith unto the waters of the great deep, Be  thou dried up, and it is done.</p> <p>12:17 Behold, if he saith unto this mountain, Be thou raised up, and come  over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up, and behold it is done.</p> <p>12:18 And behold, if a man hideth up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord  shall say, Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him that hath hid it  up, behold, it shall be accursed;</p> <p>12:19 and if the Lord shall say, Be thou accursed, that no man shall find  thee from this time henceforth and forever, and behold, no man getteth it  henceforth and forever.</p> <p>12:20 And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man, Because of thine  iniquities thou shalt be accursed forever, and it shall be done.</p> <p>12:21 And if the Lord shall say, Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be  cut off from my presence, and he will cause that it shall be so.</p> <p>12:22 And wo unto whom he shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will  do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might  be saved, hath repentance been declared.</p> <p>12:23 Therefore, blessed are they who will repent, and hearken unto the voice  of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved.</p> <p>12:24 And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto  repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace, for grace  according to their works.</p> <p>12:25 And I would that all men might be saved. But we read that in that great  and last day, there are some which shall be cast out; yea, which shall be cast  off from the presence of the Lord;</p> <p>12:26 yea, which shall be consigned to the state of endless misery,  fulfilling the words which saith, That they have done good, shall have  everlasting life; and they that have done evil, shall have everlasting  damnation. And thus it is. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>13:1 And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did  still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did  observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.</p> <p>13:2 And it came to pass that in this year, there was one Samuel, a Lamanite,  came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people. And it  came to pass that he did preach many-day repentance unto the people, and they  did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land.</p> <p>13:3 But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return  again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come in his heart.</p> <p>13:4 And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into  the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched forth  his hand and cried with a loud voice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever  things the Lord put into his heart;</p> <p>13:5 and he said unto them. Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words  of the Lord, which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my  heart to say unto this people, that the sword of justice hangeth over this  people; and four hundred years passeth not away save the sword of justice  falleth upon this people;</p> <p>13:6 yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and it surely cometh unto  this people, and nothing can save this people, save it be repentance and faith  on the Lord Jesus Christ, which surely shall come into the world, and shall  suffer many things, and shall be slain for his people.</p> <p>13:7 And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did  bring glad tidings to my soul. And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it  unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would not receive  me,</p> <p>13:8 therefore thus saith the Lord, Because of the hardness of the hearts of  the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from  them, and I will withdraw my spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer,  and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them;</p> <p>13:9 and four hundred years shall not pass away, before I will cause that  they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword, and with famine,  and with pestilence;</p> <p>13:10 yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of  the fourth generation, which shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter  destruction; and this shall surely come, except ye repent, saith the Lord; and  those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.</p> <p>13:11 But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God, I will turn  away mine anger saith the Lord,; yea, thus saith the Lord, Blessed are they who  will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not;</p> <p>13:12 yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold it is because of  they which are righteous, that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, For I  perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more part of this  great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.</p> <p>13:13 But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare. But behold  if it were not for the righteous which are in this great city, behold I would  cause that fire should come down out of heaven, and destroy it.</p> <p>13:14 But behold, it is for the righteous' sake, that it is spared. But  behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall be cast out the  righteous among you, then shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this  great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which is in her;</p> <p>13:15 yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness and  abominations which is in her;</p> <p>13:16 yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in the land round about,  which is possessed by the Nephites, because of the wickedness and abominations  which is in them;</p> <p>13:17 and behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord of Hosts,  because of the people's sake which is upon the land; yea, because of their  wickedness and their abominations.</p> <p>13:18 And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and  true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth, shall find them again  no more, because of the great curse of the land , save he be a righteous man,  and shall hide it up unto the Lord:</p> <p>13:19 For I will saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto  me; and cursed be they who hideth not up their treasures unto me; for non hideth  up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up  his treasure unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem  it because of the curse of the land.</p> <p>13:20 And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because  they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts  upon their riches, I will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before  their enemies, because they will not hide them up unto me; cursed be they, and  also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.</p> <p>13:21 Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words;  yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye  are cursed because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye  have set your hearts upon them, and hath not hearkened unto the words of him who  gave them unto you.</p> <p>13:22 Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things which he hath  blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your  God for them; yea, your heart is not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell  with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes,  malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities:</p> <p>13:23 For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon  the land, and also upon your riches; and this because of your iniquities;</p> <p>13:24 yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arriven, that  ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do  slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old  time.</p> <p>13:25 And now when ye talk, ye say, If our days had been in the days of our  fathers of old, ye would not have slain the prophets; ye would not have stoned  them, and cast them out.</p> <p>13:26 Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet  come among you. and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of  your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out, and seek all  manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and  that he is a sinner, and of the Devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are  evil.</p> <p>13:27 But behold, if a man shall come among you, and shall say, Do this, and  there is no iniquity; do that, and ye shall suffer; yea, he will say, walk after  the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do  whatsoever your heart desireth; and if a man shall come among you and say this,  ye will receive him, and ye shall say that he is a prophet;</p> <p>13:28 yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance;  ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him  with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he  saith that all is well, and then ye will not find fault with him.</p> <p>13:29 O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and stiffnecked  people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you; yea, how long  will ye suffer yourselves to be lead by foolish and blind guides; yea, how long  will ye choose darkness rather than light;</p> <p>13:30 yea, behold the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you;  behold, he hath cursed the land, because of your iniquity;</p> <p>13:31 and behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that it  becometh slippery, that ye cannot hold them;</p> <p>13:32 and in the days of your poverty, ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in  vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your  destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the  Lord of Hosts. And then shall ye lament, and say,</p> <p>13:33 O Lord I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned  them, and cast them out; yea, in that day shall ye say, O that we had remembered  the Lord our God, in the day he gave us our riches, and then they would not have  become slippery, and that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone  from us.</p> <p>13:34 Behold, we layeth a tool here, and on the morrow it is gone; and  behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.</p> <p>13:35 Yea, we have hid up our treasures, and they have slipped away from us,  because of the curse of the land.</p> <p>13:36 O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came upon  us; for behold, the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we  cannot hold them.</p> <p>13:37 Behold we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the  angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are  great. O Lord, canst thou turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your  language in them days.</p> <p>13:38 But behold, your days of probation is past; ye have procrastinated the  day of your salvation, until it is everlasting too late, and your destruction is  made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye  could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which  thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and  Eternal Head.</p> <p>13:39 O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words. And I pray that t  anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be  saved.</p> <p>14:1 And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great  many more things which cannot be written.</p> <p>14:2 And behold, he saith unto them, Behold, I give unto you a sign: for five  years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the son of God to redeem all those  who shall believe on his name.</p> <p>14:3 And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his  coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in Heaven, insomuch that in the  night before he cometh, there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall  appear unto man as it is day;</p> <p>14:4 therefore there shall be one day and a night, and a day, as if it were  one day, and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye  shall know of the rising of the sun, and also of its setting; therefore they  shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless  the night shall be darkened; and it shall be night before he is born.</p> <p>14:5 And behold there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have  beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.</p> <p>14:6 And behold this is not all: there shall be many signs and wonders in  Heaven.</p> <p>14:7 And it shall come to pass that ye shall be amazed, and wonder, insomuch  that ye shall fall to the earth.</p> <p>14:8 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of  God, the same shall have everlasting life.</p> <p>14:9 And behold, thus saith the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I  should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should  prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me, Cry unto this people,  repent and prepare the ways of the Lord.</p> <p>14:10 And now because I am a Lamanite, and hath spoken unto you the words  which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are  angry with me, and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</p> <p>14:11 And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent I have come up upon  the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God  which doth await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the  conditions of repentance;</p> <p>14:12 and also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of  God, the Father of Heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things, from the  beginning; and that ye might know of his coming, to the intent that ye might  believe on his name. And if ye believe on his name,</p> <p>14:13 ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission  of them through his merits.</p> <p>14:14 And behold, again another sign I give unto you; yea, a sign of his  death;</p> <p>14:15 for behold, he surely must die, that salvation may come; yea, it  behooveth him, and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the  resurrection of the dead, that thereby man may be brought into the presence of  the Lord;</p> <p>14:16 yea, behold this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth  all mankind from the first death; that spiritual death for all mankind, by the  fall of Adam, being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as  dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</p> <p>14:17 But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all  mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord;</p> <p>14:18 yea, it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever  repenteth, the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever  repenteth not, is hewn down and cast into the fire, and there cometh upon them  again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to  things pertaining to righteousness;</p> <p>14:19 therefore repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them,  ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down  unto this second death.</p> <p>14:20 But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his  death: behold, in that day that he shall suffer death, the sun shall be darkened  and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon, and the stars; and  there shall be no light upon he face of this land, even from the time that he  shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise  again from the dead;</p> <p>14:21 yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost, there shall be  thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall  quake and tremble, and the rocks which is upon the face of this earth, which is  both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time is solid, or the  more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;</p> <p>14:22 yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in  seams, and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth;  yea, both above the earth and both beneath.</p> <p>14:23 And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many  mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places, which  are now called valleys, which shall become mountains, whose height thereof is  great.</p> <p>14:24 And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become  desolate,</p> <p>14:25 and many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead;  and many saints shall appear unto many.</p> <p>14:26 And behold thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me,  That there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours;</p> <p>14:27 and he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted,  and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the  face of the whole earth, for the space of three days.</p> <p>14:28 And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than  these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders  should come to pass, upon all the face of this land; to the intent that there  should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men;</p> <p>14:29 and this to the intent that whosoever will believe, might be saved, and  that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and  also if they are condemned, they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.</p> <p>14:30 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth,  perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for  behold ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath  given unto you a knowledge, and he hath made you free;</p> <p>14:31 he hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath  given unto you that ye might choose life or death, and ye can do good and be  restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you;  or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</p> <p>15:1 And now my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that except ye  shall repent, your houses shall be left unto you desolate;</p> <p>15:2 yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the  day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee, and there shall be  no place for refuge; and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be  heavy, and cannot flee; therefore they shall be trodden down, and shall be left  to perish;</p> <p>15:3 yea, wo unto this people which are called the people of Nephi, except  they shall repent when they shall see all those signs and wonders which shall be  showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea,  the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the  days of their iniquities hath he chastened them, because he loveth them.</p> <p>15:4 But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated, because their deeds  have been evil continually; and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of  their fathers. But behold, salvation hath come unto them, through the preaching  of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.</p> <p>15:5 And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the  path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do  observe to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, according  to the law of Moses.</p> <p>15:6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they  are string, with unwearied diligence, that they may bring the remainder of their  brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many which add to  their numbers daily.</p> <p>15:7 And behold ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as  many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the  wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the  Holy Scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written,  which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and  repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them,</p> <p>15:8 therefore as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselve, are firm  and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.</p> <p>15:9 And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they  fear to take them up lest by any means they shall sin; yea, ye can see that they  fear to sin; for behold, they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down  and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them; and  this because of their faith in Christ.</p> <p>15:10 And now because of their steadfastness when they do believe in that  thing which they do believe; for because of their firmness when they are once  enlightened, behold the Lord shall bless them and prolong their days,  notwithstanding their iniquity;</p> <p>15:11 yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief, the Lord shall prolong  their days until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers,  and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the  restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites again, to the knowledge of the truth;</p> <p>15:12 yea, I say unto you, That in the latter times, the promises of the Lord  notwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and notwithstanding  they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and  shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord  shall be merciful unto them;</p> <p>15:13 and this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be brought  to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great  and their true Shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep.</p> <p>15:14 Therefore I say unto you, It shall be better for them than for you,  except ye repent.</p> <p>15:15 For behold, had the mighty works been shewn unto them which have been  shewn unto you; yea, unto them which have dwindled in unbelief because of the  traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves, that they never would  again have dwindled in unbelief;</p> <p>15:16 therefore, saith the Lord, I will not utterly destroy them, but I will  cause that in the day of my wisdom, they shall return again unto me, saith the  Lord.</p> <p>15:17 And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites,  if they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy them,  saith the Lord, because of their unbelief, notwithstanding the many mighty works  which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth, shall these  things be, saith the Lord.</p> <p>16:1 And now it came to pass that there were many which heard the words of  Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city. And as many as  believed on his words, went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had came  forth and found him, they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring  that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</p> <p>16:2 But as many as there were which did not believe in the words of Samuel,  were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many  shot arrows at him, as he stood upon the wall; but the spirit of the Lord was  with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones, neither with  their arrows.</p> <p>16:3 Now when they saw this, that they could not hit him, there were many  more which did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to  be baptized.</p> <p>16:4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying and preaching, crying  repentance unto the people; shewing signs and wonders; working miracles among  the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come;</p> <p>16:5 telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and  remember at the time of their coming, that they had been made known unto them  beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed  on the words of Samuel, went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came  repenting and confessing their sins.</p> <p>16:6 But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel;  therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their  arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying, Take this fellow and bind him,  for behold, he hath a Devil; and because of the power of the Devil which is in  him, we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and  bind him, and away with him.</p> <p>16:7 And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast  himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his  own counrty, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</p> <p>16:8 And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were  the affairs of the people.</p> <p>16:9 And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges over  the people of Nephi.</p> <p>16:10 And thus ended also, the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the  Judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and  the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.</p> <p>16:11 And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of  the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>16:12 And there were but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save  it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more  of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth  year of the reign of the Judges.</p> <p>16:13 But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the Judges,  there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the  prophets began to be fulfilled;</p> <p>16:14 and angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them  glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the Scriptures began to be  fulfilled.</p> <p>16:15 Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were  the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites, and also the Lamanites,  and began to depend upon their own strength, and upon their own wisdom, saying:</p> <p>16:16 Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we  know that all these great and marvellous works cannot come to pass, of which  hath been spoken.</p> <p>16:17 And they began to reason and contend among themselves, saying,</p> <p>16:18 That is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so,  and he be the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and of earth, as it hath been  spoken, why will he not shew himself unto us, as well as unto they which shall  be at Jerusalem?</p> <p>16:19 Yea, why will he not shew himself in this land, as well as in the land  of Jerusalem?</p> <p>16:20 But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been  handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some  great and marvellous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a  land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep is  in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</p> <p>16:21 And they will by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one,  work some great mystery, which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to  be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them  for to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance, if we will  yield ourselves unto them all the days of our lives.</p> <p>16:22 And many more did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were  foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do  iniquity continually; yea, he did go about, spreading rumors and contentions  upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people  against that which is good, and against that which should come;</p> <p>16:23 and notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which was wrought among  the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get  great hold upon the hearts of the people, upon all the face of the land.</p> <p>16:24 And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the Judges over the  people of Nephi.</p> <p>16:25 And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman  and his sons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
