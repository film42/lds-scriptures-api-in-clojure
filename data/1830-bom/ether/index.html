He that wrote this record was  Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor;</p> <p>1:7 Coriantor was the son of Moron;</p> <p>1:8 and Moron was the son of Ethem;</p> <p>1:9 and Ethem was the son of Ahah;</p> <p>1:10 and Ahah was the son of Seth;</p> <p>1:11 and Seth was the son of Shiblon;</p> <p>1:12 and Shiblon was the son of Com;</p> <p>1:13 and Com was the son of Coriantum;</p> <p>1:14 and Coriantum was the son of Amnigaddah;</p> <p>1:15 and Amnigaddah was the son of Aaron;</p> <p>1:16 and Aaron was a descendant of Heth, who was the son of Hearthom;</p> <p>1:17 and Hearthom was the son of Lib;</p> <p>1:18 and Lib was the son of Kish;</p> <p>1:19 and Kish was the son of Corom;</p> <p>1:20 and Corom was the son of Levi;</p> <p>1:21 and Levi was the son of Kim;</p> <p>1:22 and Kim was the son of Morianton;</p> <p>1:23 and Morianton was a descendant of Riplakish;</p> <p>1:24 and Riplakish was the son of Shez;</p> <p>1:25 and Shez was the son of Heth;</p> <p>1:26 And Heth was the son of Com;</p> <p>1:27 and Com was the son of Coriantum;</p> <p>1:28 and Coriantum was the son of Emer;</p> <p>1:29 and Emer was the son of Omer;</p> <p>1:30 and Omer was the son of Shule;</p> <p>1:31 and Shule was the son of Kib;</p> <p>1:32 and Kib was the son of Orihah, which was the son of Jared;</p> <p>1:33 which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some  others and their families, from the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded  the language of the people, and swear in his wrath that they should be scattered  upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord the people  were scattered.</p> <p>1:34 And the brother of Jared, being a large and a mighty man, and being a  man highly favored of the Lord; for Jared his brother said unto him, Cry unto  the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our words.</p> <p>1:35 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and  the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he did not confound the language  of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not confounded.</p> <p>1:36 Then Jared said unto his brother, Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be  that he will turn away his anger from them which are our friends, that he  confound not their language.</p> <p>1:37 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and  the Lord had compassion upon their friends, and their families also, that they  were not confounded.</p> <p>1:38 And it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother, saying, Go  and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land; and if he will  drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but  the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth.  And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for  our inheritance.</p> <p>1:39 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord  according to that which had been spoken by the mouth of Jared.</p> <p>1:40 And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the brother Jared, and had  compassion upon him, and said unto him,</p> <p>1:41 Go to and gather together thy flocks, both male and female, of every  kind; and also of the seed of the earth of every kind, and thy families; and  also Jared thy brother and his family; and also thy friends and their families,  and the friend of Jared and their families.</p> <p>1:42 And when thou hast done this, thou shalt go at the head of them down  into the valley, which is northward. And there will I meet thee, and I will go  before thee into a land which is choice above all the land of the earth.</p> <p>1:43 And there will I bless thee and thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy  seed, and the seed of thy brother, and they which shall go with thee, a great  nation. And there shall be none greater than the nation which I will raise up  unto me of thy seed, upon all the face of the earth. And thus I will do unto  thee because of this long time which ye have cried unto me.</p> <p>2:1 And it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and  also the friends of Jared and his brother, and their families, went down into  the valley which was northward, mighty hunter,) with their flocks which they had  gathered together, male and female, of every kind.</p> <p>2:2 And they did also lay snares and catch the fowls of the air; and they did  also prepare a vessel, in the which they did carry with them the fish of the  waters;</p> <p>2:3 and they did also carry with them deseret, which by interpretation, is a  honey bee; and thus they did carry with them swarms of bees, and all manner of  that which was upon the face of the land, seeds of every kind.</p> <p>2:4 And it came to pass that when they did come down into the valley of  Nimrod, the Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a  clowd, and the brother of Jared saw him not.</p> <p>2:5 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go  forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man  been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with  them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions, whither they should travel.</p> <p>2:6 And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did build  barges, in the which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by  the hand of the Lord.</p> <p>2:7 And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the  wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of  promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had  preserved for a righteous people;</p> <p>2:8 and he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso  possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should  serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness  of his wrath should come upon them.</p> <p>2:9 And now we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that is a  land of promise, and whatsoever nation shall possess it, shall serve God, or  they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And  the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity:</p> <p>2:10 for behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands;  wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God, or shall be swept off; for it  is the everlasting decrees of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity  among the children of the land, that they are swept off.</p> <p>2:11 And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of  God, that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness  be come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you, as  the inhabitants of the land hitherto done.</p> <p>2:12 Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it,  shall be free from bondage, and captivity, and from all other nations under the  Heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, which is Jesus Christ, which  hath been manifested by the things which we have written.</p> <p>2:13 And now I proceed with my record: for behold it came to pass that the  Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea which  divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea, they pitched their tents; and  they called the name of the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents; and  dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years.</p> <p>2:14 And it came to pass at the end of the four years, that the Lord came  again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked to him. And for  the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and  chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.</p> <p>2:15 And the brother of Jared repented him of the evil which he had done, and  did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethern which were with him. And the  Lord said unto him, I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou  shalt not sin anymore, for ye shall remember that my spirit will not always  strive with man; wherefore if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe, ye shall be  cut off from the presence of the Lord. And this is my thoughts upon the land  which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above  all other lands.</p> <p>2:16 And the Lord said, Go to work and build, after the manner of barges  which ye have hitherto built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did  go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they  had built, according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were small, and  they were light upon the water;</p> <p>2:17 and they were built after a manner that they were exceeding tight; even  that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was tight  like unto a dish; and the sides thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the ends  thereof were peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the  length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut,  was tight like unto a dish.</p> <p>2:18 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord,  saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and I  have made the barges according as thou hast directed me.</p> <p>2:19 And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light, whither shall we steer.  And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air  which is in them; therefore we shall perish.</p> <p>2:20 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared, Behold, thou shalt make a  hole in the top thereof, and also in the bottom thereof; and when thou shalt  suffer for air, thou shalt unstop the hole thereof, and receive air. And if it  so be that the water come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole thereof,  that ye may not perish in the flood.</p> <p>2:21 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the  Lord commanded.</p> <p>2:22 And he cried again unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, behold I have done  even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people,  and behold, there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we  shall cross this great water in darkness?</p> <p>2:23 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared, What will ye that I should  do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows,  for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye  shall not go by the light of the fire:</p> <p>2:24 for behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the  mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out  of the depths of the sea: for the winds have gone out of my mouth, and also the  rains and the floods have I sent forth.</p> <p>2:25 And behold, I prepare you against these things: for howbeit, ye cannot  cross this great deep, save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the  winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what  will ye that I should prepare for you, that ye may have light when ye are  swallowed up in the depths of the sea?</p> <p>3:1 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the  vessels which had been prepared, was eight,) went forth unto the mount, which  they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did moulten  out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were light and clear, even as  transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount,  and cried again unto the Lord, saying,</p> <p>3:2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods.  Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with they servant because of his  weakness before thee: for we know that thou art holy, and dwellest in the  heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee: because of the fall, of our  natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a  commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according  to our desires.</p> <p>3:3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hath  driven us forth, and for this many years we have been in the wilderness;  nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and  turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer it not that they shall go  forth across this raging deep in darkness, but behold these things which I have  moulten out of the rock.</p> <p>3:4 And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou  wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy  finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall  shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have  light while we cross the sea.</p> <p>3:5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to shew  forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men.</p> <p>3:6 And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said those words,  behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones, one by one,  with his finger; and the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of  Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man,  like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord,  for he was struck with fear.</p> <p>3:7 And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth; and  the Lord said unto him, Arise, why hast thou fallen down?</p> <p>3:8 And he saith unto the Lord, I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared  lest he should smite me: for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.</p> <p>3:9 And the Lord said unto him, Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I  shall take upon me flesh and blood, and never has man come before me with such  exceeding faith as thou hast: for were it so, ye could not have seen my finger.  Sawest thou more than this?</p> <p>3:10 And he answered, Nay, Lord, shew thyself unto me.</p> <p>3:11 And the Lord said unto him, Believest thou the words which I shall  speak?</p> <p>3:12 And he answered, Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for  thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.</p> <p>3:13 And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord shewed himself unto  him, and said, Because thou knowest these things, ye are redeemed from the fall;  therefore ye are brought back into my presence; therefore I shew myself unto  you.</p> <p>3:14 Behold, I am he which was prepared from the foundation of the world, to  redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me  shall all mankind have light, and that eternally, even they which shall believe  on my name; and they shall become my sons and daughters.</p> <p>3:15 And never hath I shewed myself unto man whom I have created, for never  hath man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine  own image? Yea, even all men were created, in the beginning, after mine own  image.</p> <p>3:16 Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and  man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee  to be in the spirit, will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</p> <p>3:17 And now, as I Moroni, said I could not make a full account of these  things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say, That Jesus shewed  himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness  of the same body, even as he shewed himself unto the Nephites;</p> <p>3:18 and he ministered unto him, even as he ministered unto the Nephites: and  all this, that this man knew that he was God, because of the many great works  which the Lord had shewed unto him.</p> <p>3:19 And because of the knowledge of this man, he could not be kept from  beholding within the veil: and he saw the finger of Jesus, which when he saw, he  fell with fear: for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had faith  no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting;</p> <p>3:20 wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept  from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus, and he did minister unto him. 3:21  And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared, Behold, thou  shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard, to go forth unto the  world, until the time cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh;  wherefore, ye shall treasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and  shew it to no man.</p> <p>3:22 And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them and shall  seal them up, that no one can interpret them: for ye shall write them in a  language that they cannot read.</p> <p>3:23 And behold, these two stones will I give unto thee, and ye shall seal  them up also with the things which ye shall write.</p> <p>3:24 For behold, the language which ye shall write, I have confounded;  wherefore I will cause in mine own due time that these stones shall magnify to  the eyes of men, these things which ye shall write.</p> <p>3:25 And when the Lord had said these words, the Lord shewed unto the brother  of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that  would be; and the Lord withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of  the earth:</p> <p>3:26 for the Lord had said unto him in times before, that if he would believe  in him, that he could shew unto him all things it should be shewn unto him;  therefore the Lord could not withhold any thing from him: for he knew that the  Lord could shew him all things.</p> <p>3:27 And the Lord said unto him, Write these things and seal them up, and I  will shew them in mine own due time unto the children of men.</p> <p>3:28 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he should seal up  the two stones which he had received, and shew them not, until the Lord should  shew them unto the children of men.</p> <p>4:1 And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount  from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen: and they  were forbidden to come unto the children of men, until after that he should be  lifted up upon the cross: and for this cause did king Benjamin keep them, that  they should not come unto the world until after Christ shew himself unto his  people.</p> <p>4:2 And after that Christ truly had shewed himself unto his people, he  commanded that they should be made manifest.</p> <p>4:3 And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief, and there is  none, save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the Gospel of Christ;  therefore I am commanded that I should hide them up again in the earth.</p> <p>4:4 Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which the  brother of Jared saw; and there never was greater things made manifest, than  that which was made manifest unto the brother of Jared;</p> <p>4:5 wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have wrote  them. And he commanded me that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded  that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the  interpreters. according to the commandments of the Lord.</p> <p>4:6 For the Lord saith unto me, They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles  until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before  the Lord;</p> <p>4:7 and in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord,  even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then  will I manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the  unfolding unto them all my revelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the  Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them is.</p> <p>4:8 And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be  accursed; and he that shall deny these things, saith Jesus Christ, for I am he  which speaketh;</p> <p>4:9 and at my command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at my word,  the earth shall shake; and at my command the inhabitants thereof shall pass  away, even so as by fire;</p> <p>4:10 and he that believeth not my words, believeth not my disciples; and if  it so be that I do not speak, judge ye: for ye shall know that it is I that  speaketh, at the last day.</p> <p>4:11 But he that believeth these things which I have spoken, him will I visit  with the manifestations of my spirit, and he shall know and bear record. For  because of my spirit, he shall know that these things are true: for it  persuadeth men to do good;</p> <p>4:12 and whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good, is of me: for good  cometh of none, save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good: he  that will not believe my words, will not believe me, will not believe the Father  which sent me. For behold, I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and  the truth of the world.</p> <p>4:13 Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will shew unto you the greater  things, the knowledge which is hid up because of unbelief.</p> <p>4:14 Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it shall be made manifest unto  you how great things the father hath laid up for you, from the foundation of the  world; and it hath not come unto you, because of the unbelief.</p> <p>4:15 Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of unbelief which doth cause you to  remain in your awful state of wickedness, and hardness of heart, and blindness  of mind, then shall the great and marvellous things which have been hid up from  the foundation of the world from you; yea, when ye shall call upon the father in  my name, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then shall ye know that the  Father hath remembered the covenant which he made unto your fathers, O house of  Israel;</p> <p>4:16 and then shall my revelations which I have caused to be written by my  servant John, be unfolded in the eyes of all the people. Remember, when ye see  these things, ye shall know that the time is at hand that they shall be made  manifest in very deed;</p> <p>4:17 therefore, when ye shall receive this record, ye may know that the work  of the Father has commenced upon all the face of the land.</p> <p>4:18 Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and  believe in my Gospel, and be baptized in my name: for he that believeth, and is  baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned: and signs  shall follow them that believe in my name.</p> <p>4:19 And blessed is he that is found faithful unto my name, at the last day:  for they shall be lifted up to dwell in the kingdom prepared for them from the  foundation of the world. And behold, it is I that hath spoken it. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>5:1 And now I, Moroni, have written the words which was commanded me,  according to my memory; and I have told you the things which I have sealed up;  therefore touch them not, in order that ye may translate: for that thing is  forbidden you, except by and by it shall be wisdom in God.</p> <p>5:2 And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may shew the plates unto those  who shall assist to bring forth this work;</p> <p>5:3 and unto three shall they be shewn by the power of God; wherefore, they  shall know of a surety that these things are true.</p> <p>5:4 And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established;  and the testimony of three, and this work, in which shall be shewn forth the  power of God, and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the Holy  Ghost beareth record; and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world,  at the last day.</p> <p>5:5 And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in the name of  Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of God.</p> <p>5:6 And now, if I have no authority for these things, judge ye, for ye shall  know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and we shall stand before God  at the last day. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>6:1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of Jared and his brother.</p> <p>6:2 For it came to pass after that the Lord had prepared the stones which the  brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down  out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were  prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the  vessels thereof.</p> <p>6:3 And thus the Lord caused the stones to shine in darkness, to give light  unto men, women and children, that they might not cross the great waters in  darkness.</p> <p>6:4 And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of food, that  thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and  herds, and whatsoever beast, or animal, or fowl that they should carry with  them. And it came to pass that when they had done all these things, they got  aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending  themselves unto the Lord their God.</p> <p>6:5 And it came to pass that the Lord caused that there should a furious wind  blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were  tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.</p> <p>6:6 And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths of the  sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and  terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind.</p> <p>6:7 And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep, there was no  water that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also  they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed  about by many waters, they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth  again upon the top of the waters.</p> <p>6:8 And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the  promised land, while they were upon the waters; and thus they were driven forth  before the wind;</p> <p>6:9 and they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did  sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day  long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.</p> <p>6:10 And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea, could break  them, neither whale that could mar them: and they did have light continually,  whether it was above the water or under the water.</p> <p>6:11 And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and four days  upon the water;</p> <p>6:12 and they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And when they had  set their feet upon the shores of the promised land, they bowed themselves down  upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did  shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender  mercies over them.</p> <p>6:13 And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the land, and  began to till the earth.</p> <p>6:14 And Jared had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and Gilgah, and  Mahah, and Orihah.</p> <p>6:15 And the brother of Jared also begat sons and daughters.</p> <p>6:16 And the friend of Jared and his brother, were in number about twenty and  two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters, before they came to the  promised land; and therefore they began to be many.</p> <p>6:17 And they were taught to walk humbly before the Lord; and they were also  taught from on high.</p> <p>6:18 And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the face of the land,  and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did wax strong in the land.</p> <p>6:19 And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go  down to the grave; wherefore he saith unto Jared, Let us gather together our  people, that we may number them, that we may know of them what they will desire  of us before we go down to our graves.</p> <p>6:20 And accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the number of the  sons and daughters of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the  number of the sons and daughters of Jared were twelve, he having four sons.</p> <p>6:21 And it came to pass that they did number all their people; and after  that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the things which they would  that they should do before they went down to their graves.</p> <p>6:22 And it came to pass that the people desired of them that they should  anoint one of their sons to be a king over them.</p> <p>6:23 And now behold, this was grievous unto them. But the brother of Jared  said unto them, Surely, this thing leadeth into captivity.</p> <p>6:24 But Jared said unto his brother, Suffer them that they may have a king;  and therefore he said unto them, Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even  whom ye will.</p> <p>6:25 And it came to pass that they chose even the first born of the brother  of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would  not be their king. And the people would that his father should constrain him;  but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no  man to be their king.</p> <p>6:26 And it came to pass that they chose all the brothers of Pagag, and they  would not.</p> <p>6:27 And it came to pass that neither would the sons of Jared, even all, save  it were one; and Orihah, he was anointed to be king over the people.</p> <p>6:28 And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and they became  exceeding rich.</p> <p>6:29 And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also.</p> <p>6:30 And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly before the Lord, and did  remember how great things the Lord had done for his father, and also taught his  people how great things the Lord had done for their fathers.</p> <p>7:1 And it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the land in  righteousness all his days, whose days were exceeding many.</p> <p>7:2 And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat thirty and one, among whom  were twenty and three sons.</p> <p>7:3 And it came to pass that he also begat Kib in his old age. And it came to  pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.</p> <p>7:4 And when Corihor was thirty and two years old, he rebelled against his  father, and went over and dwelt in the land of Nehor; and he begat sons and  daughters; and they became exceeding fair; wherefore Corihor drew away many  people after him.</p> <p>7:5 And when he had gathered together an army, he came up unto the land of  Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which brought to pass the  saying of the brother of Jared, That they would be brought into captivity.</p> <p>7:6 Now the land of Moron where the king dwelt, was near the land which is  called Desolation by the Nephites.</p> <p>7:7 And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity, and his people, under  Corihor his son, until he became exceeding old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule in  his old age, while he was yet in captivity.</p> <p>7:8 And it came to pass that Shule was angry with his brother; and Shule  waxed strong, and became mighty, as to the strength of a man; and he was also  mighty in judgment.</p> <p>7:9 Wherefore he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did moulten out of the  hill, and made swords out of steel for those which he had drew away with him;  and after he had armed them with swords, he returned to the city Nehor, and gave  battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom, and  restored it unto his father Kib.</p> <p>7:10 And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father bestowed  upon him the kingdom; therefore he began to reign in the stead of his father.</p> <p>7:11 And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in righteousness; and  he did spread his kingdom upon all the face of the land, for the people had  become exceeding numerous.</p> <p>7:12 And it came to pass that Shule also begat many sons and daughters.</p> <p>7:13 And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done; wherefore  Shule gave him power in his kingdom.</p> <p>7:14 And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons and daughters. And among  the sons of Corihor, there was one whose name was Noah.</p> <p>7:15 And it came to pass that Noah rebelled against Shule, the king, and also  his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his brother, and also his brethren and  many of the people.</p> <p>7:16 And he gave battle unto Shule, the king in the which he did obtain the  land of their first inheritance; and he became a king over that part of the  land.</p> <p>7:17 And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule the king; and  he took Shule the king, and carried him away captive into Moron.</p> <p>7:18 And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the sons of  Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him, and broke down the  door of the prison and brought out their father, and placed him upon his throne  in his own kingdom;</p> <p>7:19 wherefore the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his stead;  nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule the king; and the  people which were under the reign of Shule the king, did prosper exceedingly and  wax great.</p> <p>7:20 And the country was divided; and there was two kingdoms, the kingdom of  Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the son of Noah.</p> <p>7:21 And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should give battle  unto Shule, in the which Shule did beat them, and did slay Cohor.</p> <p>7:22 And now Cohor had a son which was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the  kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule;  wherefore Shule did bestow great favor upon him, in the which he did do in the  kingdom of Shule according to his desires;</p> <p>7:23 and also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the people,  which were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry of  the people was bringing a curse upon the land, in the which they should be  destroyed, if they did not repent.</p> <p>7:24 And it came to pass that the people did revile against the prophets, and  did mock them. And it came to pass that king Shule did execute judgment against  all those who did revile against the prophets;</p> <p>7:25 and he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave power unto  the prophets that they should go whithersoever they would; and by this cause the  people were brought unto repentance.</p> <p>7:26 And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idolatries,  the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land. And it  came to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in his old age.</p> <p>7:27 And there was no more wars in the days of Shule; and he remembered the  great things that the Lord had done for his fathers in bringing them across the  great deep into the promised land; wherefore he did execute judgment in  righteousness all his days.</p> <p>8:1 And it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead.  And Omer begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters.</p> <p>8:2 And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in the land of  Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter much people, because of his  cunning words until he had gained the half of the kingdom.</p> <p>8:3 And when he had gained the half of the kingdom, he gave battle unto his  father, and he did carry away his father into captivity, and did make him serve  in captivity.</p> <p>8:4 And now in the days of the reign of Omer, he was in captivity the half of  his days. And it came to pass that he begat sons and daughters, among whom were  Esrom and Coriantumr;</p> <p>8:5 and they were exceeding angry because of the doings of Jared their  brother, insomuch that they did raise an army, and gave battle unto Jared. And  it came to pass that they did give battle unto him by night.</p> <p>8:6 And it came to pass that when they had slew the army of Jared, they were  about to slay him also; and he plead with them that they would not slay him, and  he would give up the kingdom unto his father. And it came to pass that they did  grant unto him his life.</p> <p>8:7 And now Jared became exceeding sorrowful because of the loss of the  kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom, and upon the glory of the  world.</p> <p>8:8 Now the daughter of Jared being exceeding expert, and seeing the sorrows  of her father, thought to devise a plan whereby she could redeem the kingdom  unto her father.</p> <p>8:9 Now the daughter of Jared was exceeding fair. And it came to pass that  she did talk with her father, and saith unto him, Whereby hath my father so much  sorrow? Hath he not read the record which our fathers brought across the great  deep? Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their  secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?</p> <p>8:10 And now therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimmer; and  behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he  will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall desire of thee that ye shall give  unto him me to wife, then shall ye say, I will give her if ye will bring unto me  the head of my father, the king.</p> <p>8:11 And now Omer was a friend to Akish, wherefore when Jared had sent for  Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him, that she pleased him, insomuch  that he desired her to wife. And it came to pass that he said unto Jared, Give  her unto me to wife.</p> <p>8:12 And Jared said unto him, I will give her unto you, if ye will bring unto  me the head of my father, the king.</p> <p>8:13 And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto the house of Jared all  his kinsfolks, and saith unto them, Will ye swear unto me that ye will be  faithful unto me in the thing which I shall desire of you?</p> <p>8:14 And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God of Heaven,  and also by the Heavens, and also by the earth, and by their heads, that whoso  should vary from the assistance which Akish desired, should lose his head; and  whoso should divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same  should lose his life.</p> <p>8:15 And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And Akish did  administer unto them the oaths which was given by them of old, who also sought  power, which had been handed down even from Cain, who was a murderer from the  beginning.</p> <p>8:16 And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these  oaths unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power,  to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie, and to commit all  manner of wickedness and whoredoms.</p> <p>8:17 And it was the daughter of Jared which put it into his heart to search  up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore  Akish administered it unto his kindreds and friends, leading them away by fair  promises to do whatsoever thing he desired.</p> <p>8:18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination, even as they  of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight  of God:</p> <p>8:19 for the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will  that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the  beginning of man.</p> <p>8:20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and  combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among all  people, and they are had among the Lamanites,</p> <p>8:21 and they have caused the destruction of this people of which I am now  speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi;</p> <p>8:22 and whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations, to get  power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be  destroyed, for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints, which  shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for the  vengeance upon them, and yet he avengeth them not;</p> <p>8:23 wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should  be shewn unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that  these murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built up to get  power and gain, and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you;  yea, even the sword of justice of the eternal God, shall fall upon you, to your  overthrow and destruction, if ye shall suffer these things to be;</p> <p>8:24 wherefore the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come  among you, that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of  this secret combination which shall be among you, or wo be unto it, because of  the blood of them which have been slain: for they cry from the dust for  vengeance upon it, and also upon those who build it up.</p> <p>8:25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up, seeketh to overthrow  the freedom of all lands, nations and countries; and it bringeth to pass the  destruction of all people: for it is built up by the devil, which is the father  of all lies; even that same liar which beguiled our first parents; yea, even the  same liar which hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; which hath  hardened the hearts of men, that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned  them, and cast them out from the beginning.</p> <p>8:26 Wherefore I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things, that evil may  be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the  hearts of the children of men, that they may be persuaded to do good  continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be  saved.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>9:1 And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record. Therefore behold, it came to  pass that because of the secret combinations of Akish and his friends, behold  they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer;</p> <p>9:2 nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer, and also his sons and  daughters, which were not, or which did not seek his destruction.</p> <p>9:3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream, that he should depart out of the  land; wherefore Omer departed out of the land with his family, and travelled  many days, and came over and passed by the hill of Shim, and came over by the  place where the Nephites were destroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a  place which was called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent,  and also his sons and his daughters, and all his household, save it were Jared  and his family.</p> <p>9:4 And it came to pass that Jared was anointed king over the people, by the  hand of wickedness; and he gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.</p> <p>9:5 And it came to pass that Akish sought the life of his father-in-law; and  he applied unto those whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and they  obtained the head of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving  audience to his people:</p> <p>9:6 for so great had been the spreading of this wicked and secret society,  that it had corrupted the hearts of all the people; therefore Jared was murdered  upon his throne, and Akish reigned in his stead.</p> <p>9:7 And it came to pass that Akish began to be jealous of his son, therefore  he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon a little or no food, until he had  suffered death.</p> <p>9:8 And now the brother of him that suffered death, that which his father had  done unto his brother.</p> <p>9:9 And it came to pass that Nimrod gathered together a small number of men,  and fled out of the land, and came over and dwelt with Omer.</p> <p>9:10 And it came to pass that Akish begat other sons, and they won the hearts  of the people, notwithstanding they had sworn unto him to do all manner of  iniquity, according to that which he desired.</p> <p>9:11 Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain, even as Akish was  desirous of power; wherefore the sons of Akish did offer them money, by the  which means they drew away the more part of the people after them;</p> <p>9:12 and there began to be a war between the sons of Akish and Akish, which  lasted for the space of many years; yea, unto the destruction of nearly all the  people of the kingdom; yea, even all, save it were thirty souls, and they which  fled with the house of Omer;</p> <p>9:13 wherefore Omer was restored again to the land of his inheritance.</p> <p>9:14 And it came to pass that Omer began to be old; nevertheless, in his old  age he begat Emer; and he anointed Emer to be king to reign in his stead.</p> <p>9:15 And after that he anointed Emer to be king, he saw peace in the land for  the space of two years, and he died, having seen exceeding many days, which were  full of sorrow. And it came to pass that Emer did reign in his stead, and did  fill the steps of his father.</p> <p>9:16 And the Lord began again to take the curse from off the land, and the  house of Emer did prosper exceedingly under the reign of Emer; and in the space  of sixty and two years, they had become exceeding strong, insomuch that they  became exceeding rich,</p> <p>9:17 having all manner of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and of fine  linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things,</p> <p>9:18 and also all manner of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of sheep, and of  swine, and of goats, and also many other kind of animals, which were useful for  the food of man;</p> <p>9:19 and they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants, and  cureloms, and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and more especially the  elephants, and cureloms, and cumoms.</p> <p>9:20 And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land, which was  choice above all other lands; and he commanded that whoso should possess the  land, should possess it unto the Lord, or they should be destroyed when they  were ripened in iniquity: for upon such, saith the Lord, I will pour out the  fulness of my wrath.</p> <p>9:21 And Emer did execute judgment in righteousness, all his days; and he  begat many sons and daughters; and he begat Coriantum; and he anointed Coriantum  to reign in his stead.</p> <p>9:22 And after he anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead, he lived four  years, and he saw peace in the land; yea, and he even saw the son of  righteousness, and did rejoice and glory in his days; and he died in peace.</p> <p>9:23 And it came to pass that Coriantum did walk in the steps of his father,  and did build many mighty cities, and did administer that which is good unto his  people, in all his days. And it came to pass that he had no children, even until  he was exceeding old.</p> <p>9:24 And it came to pass that his wife died, being an hundred and two years  old. And it came to pass that Coriantum took to wife, in his old age, a young  maid, and begat sons and daughters; wherefore he lived until he was an hundred  and forty and two years old.</p> <p>9:25 And it came to pass that he begat Com, and Com reigned in his stead; and  he reigned forty and nine years, and he begat Heth, and he also begat other sons  and daughters.</p> <p>9:26 And the people had spread again over all the face of the land, and there  began to be an exceeding great wickedness upon the face of the land, and Heth  began to embrace the secret plans again of old, to destroy his father. And it  came to pass that he did dethrone his father:</p> <p>9:27 for he slew him with his own sword; and he did reign in his stead.</p> <p>9:28 And there came prophets in the land again, crying repentance unto them;  that they must prepare the way of the Lord, or there should come a curse upon  the face of the land; yea, even there should be a great famine, in the which  they should be destroyed, if they did not repent.</p> <p>9:29 But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but they cast  them out; and some of them they cast into pits, and left them to perish. And it  came to pass that they done all these things according to the commandment of the  king Heth.</p> <p>9:30 And it came to pass that there began to be a great dearth upon the land,  and the inhabitants began to be destroyed exceeding fast, because of the dearth:  for there was no rain upon the face of the earth;</p> <p>9:31 and there came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of the land,  and did poison many people. And it came to pass that their flocks began to flee  before the poisonous serpents, towards the land southward, which was called by  the Nephites, Zarahemla.</p> <p>9:32 And it came to pass that there were many of them which did perish by the  way; nevertheless, there were some which fled into the land southward.</p> <p>9:33 And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the serpents that they  should pursue them no more, but that they should hedge up the way, that the  people could not pass; that whoso should attempt to pass, might fall by the  poisonous serpents.</p> <p>9:34 And it came to pass that the people did follow the course of the beasts,  and did devour the carcasses of them which fell by the way, until they had  devoured them all. Now when the people saw that they must perish, they began to  repent of their iniquities, and cry unto the Lord.</p> <p>9:35 And it came to pass that when they humbled themselves sufficiently  before the Lord, the Lord did send rain upon the face of the earth, and the  people began to revive again, and there began to be fruits in the north  countries, and in all the countries round about. And the Lord did shew forth his  power unto them, in preserving them from famine.</p> <p>10:1 And it came to pass that Shez, which was a descendant of Heth, for Heth  had perished by the famine, and all his household, save it were Shez: wherefore  Shez began to build up again a broken people.</p> <p>10:2 And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of his  fathers, and he did build up a righteous kingdom, for he remembered what the  Lord had done in bringing Jared and his brother across the deep; and he did walk  in the ways of the Lord, and he begat sons and daughters.</p> <p>10:3 And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did rebel against him;  nevertheless, Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber, because of his exceeding  riches, which brought peace again unto his father.</p> <p>10:4 And it came to pass that his father did build up many cities upon the  face of the land, and the people began again to spread over all the face of the  land. And Shez did live to an exceeding old age; and he begat Riplakish, and he  died. And Riplakish reigned in his stead.</p> <p>10:5 And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was right in  the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and concubines, and did lay  that upon men's shoulders which was grievous to be borne; yea, he did tax them  with heavy taxes; and with the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.</p> <p>10:6 And he did erect him an exceeding beautiful throne, and he did build  many prisons, and whoso were not able to pay taxes he did cast into prison; and  he did cause that they should labor continually for their support; and whoso  refused to labor, he did cause to be put to death;</p> <p>10:7 wherefore he did obtain all his fine work; yea, even his fine gold he  did cause to be refined in prison, and all manner of fine workmanship he did  cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass that he did afflict the  people with his whoredoms and abominations;</p> <p>10:8 and when he had reigned for the space of forty and two years, the people  did raise up in rebellion against him, and there began to be war again in the  land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed and his descendants were driven out of  the land.</p> <p>10:9 And it came to pass after a space of many years, Morianton, (he being a  descendant of Riplakish,) gathered together an army of outcasts, and went forth  and gave battle unto the people; and he gained power over many cities; and the  war became exceeding sore, and did last for the space of many years, and he did  gain power over all the land, and did establish himself king over all the land.</p> <p>10:10 And after that he established himself king, he did ease the burden of  the people, in the which he did gain favor in the eyes of the people, and they  did anoint him to be their king.</p> <p>10:11 And he did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself, because of  his many whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p> <p>10:12 And it came to pass that Morianton built up many cities, and the people  became exceeding rich under his reign, both in buildings, and in gold, and in  silver, and in raising grain, and in flocks, and herds, and such things which  had been restored unto them.</p> <p>10:13 And Morianton did live to an exceeding great age, and then he begat  Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and he did reign eight years,  and his father died. And it came to pass that Kim did not reign in  righteousness, wherefore he was not favored of the Lord.</p> <p>10:14 And his brother did raise up in rebellion against him, in the which he  did bring him into captivity; and he did remain in captivity all his days; and  he begat sons and daughters in captivity; and in his old age he begat Levi, and  he died.</p> <p>10:15 And it came to pass that Levi did serve in captivity after the death of  his father, for the space of forty and two years. And he did make war against  the king of the land, in the which he did obtain unto himself the kingdom.</p> <p>10:16 And after that he had obtained unto himself the kingdom, he did that  which was right in the sight of the Lord; and the people did prosper in the  land, and he did live to a good old age, and begat sons and daughters; and he  also begat Corom, whom he anointed in his stead.</p> <p>10:17 And it came to pass that Corom did that which was good in the sight of  the Lord, all his days; and he begat many sons and daughters; and after that he  had seen many days, he did pass away, even like unto the rest of the earth; and  Kish reigned in his stead.</p> <p>10:18 And it came to pass that Kish passed away also, and Lib reigned in his  stead.</p> <p>10:19 And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in the sight  of the Lord. And in the days of Lib the poisonous serpents were destroyed;  wherefore they did go into the land southward, to hunt food for the people of  the land; for the land was covered with animals of the forest. And Lib also  became a great hunter.</p> <p>10:20 And they built a great city by the narrow neck of land, by the place  where the sea divides the land.</p> <p>10:21 And they did preserve the land southward for a wilderness, to get game.  And the whole face of the land northward was covered with inhabitants;</p> <p>10:22 and they were exceeding industrious, and they did buy and sell, and  traffic one with another, that they might get gain.</p> <p>10:23 And they did work in all manner of ore, and they did make gold, and  silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of metals; and they did dig it out  of the earth; wherefore they did cast up mighty heaps of earth for to get ore,  of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of copper. And they did work all manner  of fine work.</p> <p>10:24 And they did have silks, and fine twined linen; and they did work all  manner of cloth, that they might clothe themselves from their nakedness.</p> <p>10:25 And they did make all manner of tools to till the earth, both to plough  and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash.</p> <p>10:26 And they did make all manner of tools in the which they did work their  beasts.</p> <p>10:27 And they did make all manner of weapons of war. And they did work all  manner of work of exceeding curious workmanship.</p> <p>10:28 And never could be a people more blessed than were they. and more  prospered by the hand of the Lord. And they were in a land that was choice above  all lands, for the Lord had spoken it.</p> <p>10:29 And it came to pass that Lib did live many years, and begat sons and  daughters; and he also begat Hearthom.</p> <p>10:30 And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned in the stead of his father.  And when Hearthom had reigned twenty and four years, behold the kingdom was  taken away from him. And he served many years in captivity; yea, even all the  remainder of his days.</p> <p>10:31 And he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity all his days. And Heth  begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat Amnigaddah,  and Amnigaddah also dwelt in captivity in all his days; and he begat Coriantum,  and Coriantum dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat Com.</p> <p>10:32 And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the kingdom. And he  reigned over the half of the kingdom forty and two years; and he went to battle  against the king Amgid, and they fought for the space of many years, in the  which Com gained power over Amgid and obtained power over the remainder of the  kingdom.</p> <p>10:33 And in the days of Com there began to be robbers in the land; and they  adopted the old plans, and administered oaths after the manner of the ancients,  and sought to destroy the kingdom.</p> <p>10:34 Now Com did fight against them much; nevertheless, he did not prevail  against them.</p> <p>11:1 And there came also in the days of Com many prophets, and prophesied of  the destruction of that great people, except they should repent and turn unto  the Lord, and forsake their murders and wickedness.</p> <p>11:2 And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the people, and  they fled unto Com for protection, for the people sought to destroy them;</p> <p>11:3 and they prophesied unto Com many things: and he was blessed in all the  remainder of his days.</p> <p>11:4 And he lived to a good old age, and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom reigned  in his stead. And the brother of Shiblom rebelled against him; and there began  to be an exceeding great war in all the land.</p> <p>11:5 And it came to pass that the brother of Shiblom did cause that all the  prophets which prophesied of the destruction of the people, should be put to  death;</p> <p>11:6 and there was great calamity in all the land: for they had testified  that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the people, and that  there should be a great destruction among them, such an one as never had been  upon the face of the earth; and their bones should become as heaps of earth upon  the face of the land, except they should repent of their wickedness.</p> <p>11:7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of their  wicked combinations; wherefore there began to be wars and contentions in all the  land, and also many famines and pestilences, insomuch that there was a great  destruction, such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth: and  all this came to pass in the days of Shiblom.</p> <p>11:8 And the people began to repent of their iniquity; inasmuch as they did,  the Lord did have mercy on them.</p> <p>11:9 And it came to pass that Shiblom was slain, and Seth was brought into  captivity; and he did dwell in captivity all his days.</p> <p>11:10 And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did obtain the kingdom; and he  did reign over the people all his days. And he did do all manner of iniquity in  his days, in the which he did cause the shedding of much blood; and few were his  days.</p> <p>11:11 And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom; and he  also did do that which was wicked in his days.</p> <p>11:12 And it came to pass in the days of Ethem, there came many prophets and  prophesied again unto the people; yea, they did prophesy that the Lord would  utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth, except they repented of  their iniquities.</p> <p>11:13 And it came to pass that the people hardened their hearts, and would  not hearken unto their words; and the prophets mourned and withdrew from among  the people.</p> <p>11:14 And it came to pass that Ethem did execute judgment in wickedness all  his days; and he begat Moron. And it came to pass that Moron did reign in his  stead; and Moron did do that which was wicked before the Lord.</p> <p>11:15 And it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the people,  because of that secret combination which was built up to get power and gain; and  there arose a mighty man among them in iniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in  the which he did overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half  of the kingdom for many years.</p> <p>11:16 And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow him, and did obtain the  kingdom again.</p> <p>11:17 And it came to pass that there arose another mighty man; and he was a  descendant of the brother of Jared.</p> <p>11:18 And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron and obtain the kingdom;  wherefore Moron dwelt in captivity all the remainder of his days; and he begat  Coriantor.</p> <p>11:19 And it came to pass that Coriantor dwelt in captivity all his days.</p> <p>11:20 And in the days of Coriantor there also came many prophets, and  prophesied of great and marvellous things, and cried repentance unto the people,  and except they should repent, the Lord God would execute judgment against them  to their utter destruction;</p> <p>11:21 and that the Lord God would send or bring forth another people to  possess the land, by his power, after the manner which he brought their fathers.</p> <p>11:22 And they did reject all the words of the prophets, because of their  secret society and wicked abominations.</p> <p>11:23 And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether, and he died, having  dwelt in captivity all his days.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>12:1 And it came to pass that the days of Ether was in the days of  Coriantumr; and Coriantumr was king over all the land.</p> <p>12:2 And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came forth in the  days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the people, for he could not be  constrained because of the spirit of the Lord which was in him:</p> <p>12:3 for he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the sun,  exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance, lest they should be  destroyed saying unto them, That by faith all things are fulfilled;</p> <p>12:4 wherefore, whoso believeth in God, might with surety hope for a better  world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith,  maketh an anchor to the souls of men; which make them sure and steadfast, always  abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p> <p>12:5 And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvellous things  unto the people. which they did not believe, because they saw them not.</p> <p>12:6 And Now I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things: I would  shew unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen;  wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after  the trial of your faith:</p> <p>12:7 for it was by faith that Christ shewed himself unto our fathers, after  that he had risen from the dead; and he shewed not himself unto them, until  after they had faith in him, for he shewed himself not unto the world. But  because of the faith of men, he has shewn himself unto the world,</p> <p>12:8 and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby  others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those  things which they have not seen;</p> <p>12:9 wherefore ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye  will have faith.</p> <p>12:10 Behold, it was by faith that they of old were called after the holy  order of God;</p> <p>12:11 wherefore by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the gift of his  Son, hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath  been fulfilled:</p> <p>12:12 for if there be no faith among the children of men, God can do no  miracle among them; wherefore he shewed not himself until after their faith.  12:13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the prison to  tumble to the earth.</p> <p>12:14 Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi, that wrought the change  upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>12:15 Behold it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which wrought so  great a miracle among the Lamanites;</p> <p>12:16 yea, and even all they which wrought miracles, wrought them by faith,  even those which were before Christ, and also them which were after.</p> <p>12:17 And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that  they should not taste of death; and they obtained not the promise until after  their faith.</p> <p>12:18 And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their  faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.</p> <p>12:19 And there were many whose faith was so exceeding strong even before  Christ came, which could not be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with  their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were  glad.</p> <p>12:20 And behold, we have seen in this record, that one of these was the  brother of Jared: for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his  finger, he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of  his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith.</p> <p>12:21 And after that the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord,  because of the promise which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the  Lord could not withhold any thing from his sight; wherefore he shewed him all  things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.</p> <p>12:22 And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise that these  things should come unto their brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the Lord  hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ.</p> <p>12:23 And I said unto him, Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things  because of our weakness in writing: for Lord, thou hast made us mighty in word  by faith, whereunto thou hast not made us mighty in writing: for thou hast made  all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou  hast given them;</p> <p>12:24 and thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the  awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like  unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote,  were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.</p> <p>12:25 Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot  write them; wherefore, when we write, we behold our weakness, and stumble  because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at  our words.</p> <p>12:26 And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying, Fools mock,  but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall  take no advantage of your weakness:</p> <p>12:27 and if men come unto me, I will shew unto them their weakness. I give  unto men weakness, that they may be humble. and my grace is sufficient for all  men that humble themselves before me: for if they humble themselves before me,  and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p> <p>12:28 Behold, I will shew unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will shew  unto them that faith, hope, and charity, bringeth unto me the fountain of all  righteousness.</p> <p>12:29 And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was comforted, and said, O  Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest unto the children  of men according to their faith:</p> <p>12:30 for the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove, and it  was removed. And if he had not faith, it would not have moved; wherefore thou  workest after that men have faith:</p> <p>12:31 for thus did thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples. For after that  they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst shew thyself unto them in  great power;</p> <p>12:32 and I also rememberest that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a  house for man; yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in the which man  might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive  an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.</p> <p>12:33 And again I remember that thou hast said that thou loved the world,  even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it  again to prepare a place for the children of men. And now I know that this love  which thou hast had for the children of men,</p> <p>12:34 is charity; wherefore, except men shall have charity, they cannot  inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of they Father.</p> <p>12:35 Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the  Gentiles have not charity because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them,  and take away their talent, yea, even that which they have received, and give  unto them which shall have more abundantly.</p> <p>12:36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto  the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity.</p> <p>12:37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me, if they have not  charity, it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore thy  garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou  shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have  prepared in the mansions of my Father.</p> <p>12:38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto  my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment seat of Christ,  where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood;</p> <p>12:39 and then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked  with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man  telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;</p> <p>12:40 and only a few have I written, because of my weakness in writing.</p> <p>12:41 And now I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and  Apostles have written, that the Grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus  Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be, and abide in  you forever. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>13:1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the  destruction of the people of which I have been writing.</p> <p>13:2 For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether: for he truly told them  of all things, from the beginning of man; and how that after the waters had  receded from off the face of this land, it became a choice land above all other  lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men  should serve him, which dwelleth upon the face thereof;</p> <p>13:3 and that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should come down  out of Heaven, and the Holy Sanctuary of the Lord.</p> <p>13:4 Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning a New  Jerusalem upon this land;</p> <p>13:5 and he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem from  whence Lehi should come; after that it should be destroyed, it should be built  up again a holy city unto the Lord; wherefore it could not be a New Jerusalem,  for it had been in a time of old, but it should be built up again, and become a  holy city of the Lord; and it should be built up unto the house of Israel;</p> <p>13:6 and that a New Jerusalem should be built up upon this land, unto the  remnant of the seed of Joseph, for the which things there has been a type:</p> <p>13:7 for as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he  died there; wherefore the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of  the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph, that  they should perish not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph, that  he should perish not;</p> <p>13:8 wherefore the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this  land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a  holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall no more  be confounded, until the end come, when the earth shall pass away.</p> <p>13:9 And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they shall be like  unto the old, save the old have passed away, and all things have become new.</p> <p>13:10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they which dwell  therein, for it is they whose garment are white through the blood of the Lamb;  and they are they which are numbered among the remnant of the seed of Joseph,  which were of the house of Israel.</p> <p>13:11 And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the inhabitants thereof,  blessed are they, for they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and they  are they which were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the  earth, and from the north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the  covenant which God made with their father Abraham.</p> <p>13:12 And when these things come, bringeth to pass the Scripture which saith,  There are they which were first, which shall be last; and there are they which  were last, which shall be first.</p> <p>13:13 And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and  marvellous were the prophecies of Ether, but they esteemed him as nought, and  cast him out, and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he  went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people.</p> <p>13:14 And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock, he made the remainder of this  record, viewing the destructions which came upon the people by night.</p> <p>13:15 And it came to pass that in that same year which he was cast out from  among the people, there began to be a great war among the people, for there were  many which rose up who were mighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by  their secret plans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken.</p> <p>13:16 And now Coriantumr, having studied himself in all the arts of war, and  all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle unto them which sought to  destroy him;</p> <p>13:17 but he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters; neither the  fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of  Corihor; and in fine, there was none of the fair sons and daughters upon the  face of the whole earth, which repented of their sins;</p> <p>13:18 wherfore it came to pass that in the first year that Ether dwelt in the  cavity of a rock, there was many people which was slain by the sword of those  secret combinations fighting against Coriantumr, that they might obtain the  kingdom.</p> <p>13:19 And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr fought much, and bled  much.</p> <p>13:20 And in the second year, the word of the Lord came to Ether, that he  should go and prophesy unto Coriantumr, that if he would repent, and all his  household, the Lord would give unto him his kingdom, and spare the people,</p> <p>13:21 otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household, save it were  himself, and he should only live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies which  had been spoken concerning another people receiving the land for their  inheritance; and Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul  should be destroyed save it were Coriantumr.</p> <p>13:22 And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his  household, neither the people; and the wars did cease not; and they sought to  kill Ether, but he fled from before them, and hid again in the cavity of the  rock.</p> <p>13:23 And it came to pass that there arose up Shared, and he also gave battle  unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that in the third year he did  bring him into captivity.</p> <p>13:24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year, did beat Shared, and  did obtain the kingdom again unto their father.</p> <p>13:25 Now there began to be a war upon all the face of the land, every man  with his band, fighting for that which he desired.</p> <p>13:26 And there was robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness upon all  the face of the land.</p> <p>13:27 And it came to pass that Coriantumr was exceeding angry with Shared,  and he went against him with his armies, to battle; and they did meet in great  anger; and they did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and the battle became  exceeding sore.</p> <p>13:28 And it came to pass that Shared fought against him for the space of  three days. And it came to pass that Coriantumr beat him, and did pursue him  until he came to the plains of Heshlon.</p> <p>13:29 And it came to pass that Shared gave him battle again upon the plains;  and behold, he did beat Coriantumr, and drove him back again to the valley of  Gilgal.</p> <p>13:30 And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in the  which he beat Shared, and slew him.</p> <p>13:31 And Shared wounded Coriantumr, in his thigh, that he did not go to  battle again for the space of two years, in the which time all the people upon  all the face of the land were a shedding blood, and there was none to constrain  them.</p> <p>14:1 And now there began to be a great curse upon the land, because of the  iniquity of the people, in the which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword  upon the shelf, or upon the place whither he would keep it, and behold, upon the  morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land.</p> <p>14:2 Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own, with his  hands, and would not borrow, neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt  of his sword thereof, in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his  own life, and they of his wives and children.</p> <p>14:3 And now after the space of two years, and after the death of Shared,  behold, there arose the brother of Shared, and he gave battle unto Coriantumr,  in the which Coriantumr did beat him, and did pursue him to the wilderness of  Akish.</p> <p>14:4 And it came to pass that the brother of Shared did give battle unto him  in the wilderness of Akish; and the battle became exceeding sore, and many  thousands fell by the sword.</p> <p>14:5 And it came to pass that Coriantumr did lay siege to the wilderness, and  the brother of Shared did march forth out of the wilderness by night, and slew a  part of the army of Coriantumr, as they were drunken.</p> <p>14:6 And he came forth to the land of Moron, and placed himself upon the  throne of Coriantumr.</p> <p>14:7 And it came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with his army in the  wilderness, for the space of two years, in the which he did receive great  strength to his army.</p> <p>14:8 Now the brother of Shared, whose name was Gilead, also received great  strength to his army, because of secret combinations.</p> <p>14:9 And it came to pass that his High Priest murdered him as he sat upon his  throne.</p> <p>14:10 And it came to pass that one of the secret combinations murdered him in  the secret pass, and obtained unto himself the kingdom; and his name was Lib;  and Lib was a man of great stature, more than any other man among all the  people.</p> <p>14:11 And it came to pass that in the first year of Lib, Coriantumr came up  unto the land of Moron, and gave battle with Lib,</p> <p>14:12 in the which Lib did smite upon his arm, that he was wounded;  nevertheless, the army of Coriantumr did press forward upon Lib, that he fled to  the borders upon the seashore.</p> <p>14:13 And it came to pass that Coriantumr pursued him; and Lib gave battle  unto him upon the seashore.</p> <p>14:14 And it came to pass that Lib did smite the army of Coriantumr, that  they fled again to the wilderness of Akish.</p> <p>14:15 And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him until he came to the plains  of Agosh. And Coriantumr had taken all the people with him, as he fled before  Lib, in that quarter of the land whither he fled.</p> <p>14:16 And when he had come to the plains of Agosh, he gave battle unto Lib,  and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the brother of Lib did come  against Coriantumr in the stead thereof, and the battle became exceeding sore,  in the which Coriantumr fled again before the army of the brother of Lib.</p> <p>14:17 Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz. And it came to pass  that Shiz pursued after Coriantumr, and he did overthrow many cities, and he did  slay both women and children, and he did burn the cities thereof;</p> <p>14:18 and there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a cry went  forth throughout the land: Who can stand before the army of Shiz? Behold, he  sweepeth the earth before him!</p> <p>14:19 And it came to pass that the people began to flock together in armies,  throughout all the face of the land.</p> <p>14:20 And they were divided, and a part of them fled to the army of Shiz, and  a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.</p> <p>14:21 And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had been the  scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered with  the bodies of the dead;</p> <p>14:22 and so swift and speedy was the war, that there was none left to bury  the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of blood, to the shedding  of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women and children, strewed upon the  face of the land, to become a prey to the worms of the flesh;</p> <p>14:23 and the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon  all the face of the land; wherefore the people became troubled by day and by  night, because of the scent thereof;</p> <p>14:24 nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr, for he had sworn  to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, which had been  slain, and the word of the Lord which came to Ether, that Coriantumr should not  fall by the sword.</p> <p>14:25 And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of his  wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared a way for their  everlasting destruction.</p> <p>14:26 And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue Coriantumr eastward, even to  the borders by the seashore, and there he gave battle unto Shiz for the space of  three days;</p> <p>14:27 and so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz, that the  people began to be frightened, and began to flee before the armies of  Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the inhabitants  before them, all they that would not join them;</p> <p>14:28 and they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor. And Coriantumr  pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr. Now the valley of Shurr was near the  hill Comnor; wherefore Coriantumr did gather his armies together, upon the hill  of Comnor, and did sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz, to invite them forth  to battle.</p> <p>14:29 And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven back again;  and they came a second time; and they were driven again a second time. And it  came to pass that they came again the third time, and the battle became  exceeding sore.</p> <p>14:30 And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr, that he gave him  many deep wounds. And Coriantumr having lost his blood, fainted, and was carried  away as though he were dead.</p> <p>14:31 Now the loss of men, women and children, on both sides, were so great  that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of  Coriantumr; wherefore they returned to their camp.</p> <p>15:1 And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had recovered of his wounds, he  began to remember the words which Ether had spoken unto him:</p> <p>15:2 He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly two  millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been  slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.</p> <p>15:3 He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember  the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw  them that they were fulfilled, thus far, every whit; and his soul mourned, and  refused to be comforted.</p> <p>15:4 And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him  that he would spare the people, and he would give up the kingdom for the sake of  the lives of the people.</p> <p>15:5 And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle, he wrote an  epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself up, that he might slay  him with his own sword, that he would spare the lives of the people.</p> <p>15:6 And it came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity; and  the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz;  and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger against the people of  Coriantumr; wherefore the people of Shiz did battle unto the people of  Coriantumr.</p> <p>15:7 And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall, he fled again before  the people of Shiz.</p> <p>15:8 And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum, which, by  interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore, when they came to these  waters, they pitched their tents; and Shiz also pitched his tents, near unto  them; and therefore, on the morrow, they did come to battle.</p> <p>15:9 And it came to pass that they fought an exceeding sore battle, in the  which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted with the loss of blood.</p> <p>15:10 And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press upon the  armies of Shiz, that they beat them, that they caused them to flee before them;  and they did flee southward, and did pitch their tents in a place which was  called Ogath.</p> <p>15:11 And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents  by the hill Ramah; and it was the same hill where my father Mormon did hide up  the records unto the Lord, which were sacred.</p> <p>15:12 And it came to pass that they did gather together all the people, upon  all the face of the land, which had not been slain, save it were Ether.</p> <p>15:13 And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of the people;  and he beheld that the people which were for Coriantumr, were gathered together  to the army of Coriantumr; and the people which were for Shiz, were gathered  together to the army of Shiz;</p> <p>15:14 wherefore they were for the space of four years, gathering together the  people, that they might get all which were upon the face of the land, and that  they might receive all the strength which it were possible that they could  receive.</p> <p>15:15 And it came to pass that when they were all gathered together, every  one to the army which he would, with their wives, and their children; both men,  women and children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and  breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war, they  did march forth one against another, to battle; and they fought all that day,  and conquered not.</p> <p>15:16 And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired  to their camps; and after that they had retired to their camps, they took up a  howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain people; and so great were  their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did rend the air  exceedingly.</p> <p>15:17 And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle, and  great and terrible was that day; nevertheless they conquered not, and when the  night came again, they did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings,  and their mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.</p> <p>15:18 And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto Shiz,  desiring that he would not come again to battle but that he would take the  kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.</p> <p>15:19 But behold, the spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and  Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were given up unto  the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds, that they might  be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle.</p> <p>15:20 And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and when the night  came they slept upon their swords;</p> <p>15:21 and on the morrow they fought even until the night came;</p> <p>15:22 and when the night came they were drunken with anger, even as a man  which is drunken with wine and they slept again upon their swords;</p> <p>15:23 and on the morrow they fought again; and when the night came they had  all fallen by the sword, save it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr,  and sixty and nine of the people of Shiz.</p> <p>15:24 And it came to pass that they slept upon their swords that night, and  on the morrow they fought again, and they contended in their mights with their  swords, and with their shields, all that day;</p> <p>15:25 and when the night came there was thirty and two of the people of Shiz,  and twenty and seven of the people of Coriantumr.</p> <p>15:26 And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for death on  the morrow. And they were large and mighty men, as to the strength of men.</p> <p>15:27 And it came to pass that they fought for the space of three hours, and  they fainted with the loss of blood.</p> <p>15:28 And it came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received  sufficient strength, that they could walk, they were about to flee for their  lives, but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in his wrath that  he would slay Coriantumr, or he would perish by the sword;</p> <p>15:29 wherefore he did pursue them; and they fought again with the sword. And  it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were  Coriantumr and Shiz, behold, Shiz had fainted with loss of blood.</p> <p>15:30 And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword,  that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.</p> <p>15:31 And it came to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz, that  Shiz raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for breath,  he died.</p> <p>15:32 And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth, and became as if  he had no life.</p> <p>15:33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him, Go forth. And he went  forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he  finished his record; (and the hundredth part I have not written,) and he hid  them in a manner that the people of Limhi did find them.</p> <p>15:34 Now the last words which are written by Ether are these: Whether the  Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the  flesh: It mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God.  Amen.</p>
