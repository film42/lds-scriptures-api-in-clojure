    <h2 style="text-align: center;">1830 Book of Mormon<br />1 Nephi</h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four Sons, being called,  (beginning at the eldest,) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to  depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people  concerning their iniquity; and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three  days journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and  returns to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of  their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their  families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the  wilderness. The course of their travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi's  brethren rebelled against him. He confounded them, and buildeth a Ship. They  call the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the promised land,  &amp;c. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I Nephi wrote  this record.</p> <p>1:1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught  somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in  the course of my days --nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in  all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries  of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days;</p> <p>1:2 yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the  learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.</p> <p>1:3 And I know that the record which I make, to be true; and I make it with  mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.</p> <p>1:4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of  Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father Lehi having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his  days;) and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the  people, that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.</p> <p>1:5 Wherefore it came to pass, that my father Lehi, as he went forth, prayed  unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.</p> <p>1:6 And it came to pass, as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of  fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard, he did quake and  tremble exceedingly.</p> <p>1:7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and  he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the spirit and the things  which he had seen;</p> <p>1:8 and being thus overcome with the spirit, he was carried away in a vision,  even that he saw the Heavens open; and he thought he saw God sitting upon his  throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of  singing and praising their God.</p> <p>1:9 And it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the midst of  Heaven, and he beheld that his lustre was above that of the sun at noon-day;</p> <p>1:10 and he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did  exceed that of the stars in the firmament;</p> <p>1:11 and they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the  first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a Book, and bade him  that he should read.</p> <p>1:12 And it came to pass as he read, he was filled with the spirit of the  Lord,</p> <p>1:13 and he read saying, Wo, wo unto Jerusalem! for I have seen thine  abominations; yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem  --that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof, many should perish  by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.</p> <p>1:14 And it came to pass that when my father had read and saw many great and  marvellous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as, Great and  marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the  Heavens, and the power and goodness, and mercy is over all the inhabitants of  the earth; and because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come  unto thee that they shall perish!</p> <p>1:15 And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of  his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of  the things which he had seen; yea, which the Lord had shewn unto him.</p> <p>1:16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my  father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and  in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake  unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account;</p> <p>1:17 but I will make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold I make  an abridgement of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with  mine own hands; wherefore, after that I have abridged the record of my father,  then will I make an account of mine own life.</p> <p>1:18 Therefore, I would that ye should know that after the Lord had shewn  marvellous things unto my father Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of  Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people and began to prophesy and to  declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.</p> <p>1:19 And it came to pass that the Jews did not mock him because of the things  which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their  abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also  the things which he read in the Book, manifested plainly of the coming of a  Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.</p> <p>1:20 And when the Jews heard these things, they were angry with him; yea,  even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out and stoned and slain;  and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I,  Nephi will shew unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord is over all them  whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the  power of deliverance.</p> <p>2:1 For behold it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father., yea, even  in a dream, and sayeth unto him, Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things  which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this  people the things which I commanded thee, behold they seek to take away thy  life.</p> <p>2:2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father even in a dream,  that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.</p> <p>2:3 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord,  wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.</p> <p>2:4 And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his  house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his  precious things, and took nothing with him save it were his family, and  provisions, and tents, and he departed into the wilderness;</p> <p>2:5 and he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he  travelled in the wilderness, in the borders, which was nearer the Red Sea; and  he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother,  Sariah, and my elder brothers, which were Laman, Lemuel and Sam.</p> <p>2:6 And it came to pass that when he had travelled three days in the  wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley beside a river of water.</p> <p>2:7 And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and he made an  offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.</p> <p>2:8 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river Laman, and it  emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the mouth  thereof.</p> <p>2:9 And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the  fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be  like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of all  righteousness.</p> <p>2:10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this  valley, firm, and steadfast, and immoveable in keeping the commandments of the  Lord.</p> <p>2:11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel;  for behold; they did murmur in many things against their father, because that he  was a visionary man, and that he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to  leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their  precious things, and to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done  because of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 2:12 And thus Laman and  Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father. And they did murmur  because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.</p> <p>2:13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be  destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were like unto the  Jews, which were at Jerusalem, which sought to take away the life of my father.</p> <p>2:14 And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of  Lemuel, with power, being filled with the spirit, until their frames did shake  before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter against him;  wherefore they did do as he commanded them.</p> <p>2:15 And my father dwelt in a tent.</p> <p>2:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceeding young, nevertheless  being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries  of God, wherefore I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did  soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my  father; wherefore I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</p> <p>2:17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which the Lord  had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he believed  in my words;</p> <p>2:18 but behold Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words: And being  grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, I cried unto the Lord for them.</p> <p>2:19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art  thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with  lowiness of heart.</p> <p>2:20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and  shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for  you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.</p> <p>2:21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut  off from the presence of the Lord.</p> <p>2:22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a  ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.</p> <p>2:23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me. I will curse  them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed, except  they shall rebel against me also.</p> <p>2:24 And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto  thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.</p> <p>3:1 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord,  to the tent of my father.</p> <p>3:2 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed  a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren  shall return to Jerusalem.</p> <p>3:3 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews, and also a genealogy of my  forefathers, and they are engraven upon the plates of brass.</p> <p>3:4 Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go  unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into  the wilderness.</p> <p>3:5 And now, behold, thy brothers murmur, saying: It is a hard thing which I  have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is  commanded of the Lord. Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the  Lord,</p> <p>3:6 because thou hast not murmured.</p> <p>3:7 And it came to pass, that I, Nephi, said unto my father, I will go and do  the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no  commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that  they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth of them.</p> <p>3:8 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words, he was  exceeding glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.</p> <p>3:9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren, took our journey in the wilderness with  our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.</p> <p>3:10 And it came to pass that when we had come up to the land of Jerusalem, I  and my brethren did consult one with another;</p> <p>3:11 and we cast lots, which of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And  it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house  of Laban and he talked with him as he sat in his house.</p> <p>3:12 And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates  of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.</p> <p>3:13 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out of  his presence; and he would not that he should have records. Wherefore he said  unto him, behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee.</p> <p>3:14 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had  done, unto us. And we began to be exceeding sorrowful, and my brethren were  about to return unto my father in the wilderness.</p> <p>3:15 But behold I said unto them, that as the Lord liveth, and as we live, we  will not go down unto our father in the wilderness, until we have accomplished  the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.</p> <p>3:16 Wherefore let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord;  therefore let us go down to the land of our father's inheritance, for behold he  left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done,  because of the commandments of the Lord:</p> <p>3:17 for he knowing that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the  wickedness of the people.</p> <p>3:18 For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets. Wherefore if  my father should dwell in the land after that he hath been commanded to flee out  of the land, behold he would also perish. Wherefore it must needs be that he  flee out of the land.</p> <p>3:19 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records,  that we might preserve unto our children the language of our fathers;</p> <p>3:20 and also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken  by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by  the spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto the present  time.</p> <p>3:21 And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my  brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God.</p> <p>3:22 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance,  and we did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things.</p> <p>3:23 And after that we had gathered these things together, we went up again  unto the house of Laban.</p> <p>3:24 And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he  would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for  which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious  things.</p> <p>3:25 And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was  exceeding great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent  his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.</p> <p>3:26 And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and  we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of  Laban.</p> <p>3:27 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants  of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock.</p> <p>3:28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my  father; and also Lemuel; for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore  Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and  they did smite us even with a rod. And it came to pass as they smote us with a  rod,</p> <p>3:29 behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake  unto them saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not  that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you , and this because of your  iniquities? Behold thou shalt go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will  deliver Laban into your hands.</p> <p>3:30 And after that the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.</p> <p>3:31 And after that angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to  murmur, saying, how is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our  hands? Behold he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can  slay fifty; then why not us?</p> <p>4:1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up  again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the  Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than  Laban and his fifty yea, or even than his tens of thousands.</p> <p>4:2 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses: For he truly  spake unto the waters of the Red Sea, and they divided hither and thither, and  our fathers came through out of captivity on dry ground, and the armies of  Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.</p> <p>4:3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath  spoken unto you, wherefore can ye doubt. Let us go up; the Lord is able to  deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.</p> <p>4:4 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and still did  continue to murmur; Nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without the  walls of Jerusalem.</p> <p>4:5 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves  without the walls. And after that they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into  the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.</p> <p>4:6 And I was led by the spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I  should do.</p> <p>4:7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near the house of Laban, I  beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with  wine.</p> <p>4:8 And when I came to him, I found that it was Laban.</p> <p>4:9 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof, and  the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceeding  fine; and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.</p> <p>4:10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the spirit that I should  kill Laban; but I said in my heart, never at any time have I shed blood of man,  and I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.</p> <p>4:11 And the spirit saith unto me again, behold the Lord hath delivered him  into thy hands; yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own  life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he  also had taken away our property.</p> <p>4:12 And it came to pass that the spirit said unto me again, slay him, for  the Lord hath delivered him into my hands.</p> <p>4:13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous  purposes: it is better that one man should perish, than that a nation should  dwindle and perish in unbelief.</p> <p>4:14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of  the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying, that inasmuch as thy  seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.</p> <p>4:15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the  Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law.</p> <p>4:16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.</p> <p>4:17 And again --I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands, for  this cause: that I might obtain the records according to his commandments.</p> <p>4:18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the spirit, and took Laban by the hair  of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.</p> <p>4:19 And after that I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I took the  garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; and I  did gird on his armour about my loins.</p> <p>4:20 And after that I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban,  And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold I saw the servant of  Laban which had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of  Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury;</p> <p>4:21 and he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the garments,  and also the sword girted about my loins.</p> <p>4:22 And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing that  his master Laban had been out by night among them.</p> <p>4:23 And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.</p> <p>4:24 And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings which were  upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, which were without the walls.</p> <p>4:25 And I also bade him that he should follow me.</p> <p>4:26 And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I  was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me.</p> <p>4:27 And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I  went forth unto my brethren, which were without walls.</p> <p>4:28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me, he was exceedingly  frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for  they supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me, and had sought to take  away their lives also.</p> <p>4:29 And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me;  wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.</p> <p>4:30 And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren,  he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me and return to the city  of Jerusalem.</p> <p>4:31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received  much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the servant of Laban, and  held him, that he should not flee.</p> <p>4:32 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto  my words, as the Lord liveth and as I live, even so that if he would hearken  unto our words, we would spare his life.</p> <p>4:33 And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear; that he  should be a free man like unto us, if he would go down in the wilderness with  us.</p> <p>4:34 And I also spake unto him, saying, surely the Lord hath commanded us to  do this thing. And shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the  Lord? therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father, thou  shalt have place with us.</p> <p>4:35 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words which I  spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would go  down into the wilderness unto our father. And he also made an oath unto us, that  he would tarry with us from that time forth.</p> <p>4:36 Now we were desirous that we should tarry with us for this cause: that  the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they  should pursue us and destroy us.</p> <p>4:37 And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us, our fears  did cease concerning him.</p> <p>4:38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the servant of  Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journied into the tent of our  father.</p> <p>5:1 And it came to pass after we had came down into the wilderness unto our  father, behold he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceeding  glad, for she truly had mourned because of us;</p> <p>5:2 for she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also  had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man;  saying, behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my  sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.</p> <p>5:3 And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my  father.</p> <p>5:4 And it came to pass that my father spake unto her saying: I know that I  am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision, I  should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem and had  perished with my children.</p> <p>5:5 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which thing I do  rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of  Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.</p> <p>5:6 And after this manner of language did my father Lehi comfort my mother  Sariah, concerning us, while we journied in the wilderness up to the land of  Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.</p> <p>5:7 And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was  full, and my mother was comforted;</p> <p>5:8 and she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath  commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a  surety that the Lord hath protected my sons and delivered them out of the hands  of Laban, and gave them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the  Lord hath commanded them. And after this language did she speak.</p> <p>5:9 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer  sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God  of Israel.</p> <p>5:10 And after that they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father  Lehi took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did  search them from the beginning.</p> <p>5:11 And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave  an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, which was our  first parents;</p> <p>5:12 and also a record of Jews from the beginning, even down to the  commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah;</p> <p>5:13 and also the prophecies of the Holy prophets, from the beginning, even  down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies  which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.</p> <p>5:14 And it came to pass that my father Lehi also found upon the plates of  brass, a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of  Joseph; yea, even that Joseph which was the son of Jacob, which was sold into  Egypt, and which was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve  his father Jacob and all his household from perishing with famine.</p> <p>5:15 And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by  the same God who had preserved them.</p> <p>5:16 And thus my father Lehi did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And  Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the  records.</p> <p>5:17 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the  spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed;</p> <p>5:18 that these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds,  tongues, and people which were of his seed.</p> <p>5:19 Wherefore he said that these plates of brass should never perish;  neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many times  concerning his seed.</p> <p>5:20 And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the  commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.</p> <p>5:21 And we had obtained the record which the Lord had commanded us, and  searched them and found that they were desirable yea, even of great worth unto  us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our  children.</p> <p>5:22 Wherefore it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us,  as we journied in the wilderness towards the land of promise.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>6:1 And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of  my record; neither at any time shall I give it after upon these plates which I  am writing; for it is given in the record which has been kept by my father;  wherefore I do not write it in this work.</p> <p>6:2 For it sufficeth me to say, that we are a descendant of Joseph.</p> <p>6:3 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of  all things of my father, for they cannot be written upon these plates, for I  desire the room, that I may write of the things of God.</p> <p>6:4 For the fullness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved.</p> <p>6:5 Wherefore the things which are pleasing unto the world, I do not write,  but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto them which are not of the  world.</p> <p>6:6 Wherefore I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not  occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men.</p> <p>7:1 And now I would that ye might know, that after my father Lehi had made an  end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto  him again, saying, that it was not mete for him, Lehi, that he should take his  family into the wilderness alone; but that his sons should take daughters to  wife that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise.</p> <p>7:2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my  brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring down Ishmael  and his family into the wilderness,</p> <p>7:3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my brethren, go forth  into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem.</p> <p>7:4 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael, and we did  gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we did speak unto him the  words of the Lord.</p> <p>7:5 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of Ishmael, and  also his household, insomuch that they took their journey with us down into the  wilderness to the tent of our father.</p> <p>7:6 And it came to pass as we journied in the wilderness, behold, Laman and  Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and the two sons of Ishmael, and  their families, did rebel against us; yea, against I, Nephi, and Sam, and their  father, Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters.</p> <p>7:7 And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous to return  unto the land of Jerusalem.</p> <p>7:8 And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts,  therefore I spake unto them, saying; yea, even unto Laman and unto Lemuel,  behold, thou art mine elder brethren; and how is it that ye are so hard in your  hearts, and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that I, your younger  brother, should speak unto you, yea, and set an example for you?</p> <p>7:9 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the Lord?</p> <p>7:10 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the Lord?</p> <p>7:11 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten how great things the Lord hath  done for us in delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and also that we should  obtain the record?</p> <p>7:12 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to do  all things, according to his will, for the children of men, if it so be that  they exercise faith in him; wherefore, let us be faithful in him.</p> <p>7:13 And if it so be that we are faithful in him, we shall obtain the land of  promise; and ye shall know at some future period, that the word of the Lord  shall be fulfilled, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things  which the Lord hath spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, must be  fulfilled.</p> <p>7:14 For, behold, the spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them;  for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have they cast into  prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my father, insomuch that  they have driven him out of the land.</p> <p>7:15 Now behold, I say unto you, that if ye will return unto Jerusalem, ye  shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and  remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go, ye will also perish;  for thus the spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.</p> <p>7:16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my  brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their  hands upon me; for, behold, they were exceeding wroth; and they did bind me with  cords, 2 for they sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the  wilderness, to be devoured by wild beasts.</p> <p>7:17 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord,  according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of  my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which  I am bound.</p> <p>7:18 And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold, the bands  were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and I  spake unto them again.</p> <p>7:19 And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and sought to  lay hands upon me; but, behold, one of the daughters of Ishmael, yea, and also  her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did plead with my brethren; and they  did cease striving to take away my life.</p> <p>7:20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their  wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me,  that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.</p> <p>7:21 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had  done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God, for  forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after that they had done  praying unto the Lord, we did again travel on our journey toward the tent of our  father.</p> <p>7:22 And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our father.  And after that I and my brothers, and all the house of Ishmael, had come down  unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; and  they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him.</p> <p>8:1 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of seeds of  every kind; both of grain of every kind, and also of the seeds of fruits of  every kind.</p> <p>8:2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness, he  spake unto ,us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I  have seen a vision.</p> <p>8:3 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to  rejoice in the Lord, because of Nephi, and also of Sam, for I have reason to  suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved.</p> <p>8:4 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly, because of you; for,  behold, me thought I saw a dark and dreary wilderness.</p> <p>8:5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white robe;  and he came and stood before me.</p> <p>8:6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him.</p> <p>8:7 And it came to pass that as I followed him, and after I had followed him,  I beheld myself that I was in the dark and dreary waste.</p> <p>8:8 And after that I travelled for the space of many hours in darkness, I  began to pray unto the Lord, that he would have mercy on me, according to the  multitude of his tender mercies.</p> <p>8:9 And it came to pass that after I had prayed unto the Lord, I beheld a  large and spacious field.</p> <p>8:10 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable, to  make one happy.</p> <p>8:11 And it came to pass that I did go forth, and partake of the fruit  thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever had before  tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the  whiteness that I had ever seen.</p> <p>8:12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof, it filled my soul with exceeding  great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it  also; for I knew that it was desirous above all other fruit.</p> <p>8:13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my  family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran along, and it was near the  tree of which I was partaking the fruit.</p> <p>8:14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof,  a little way off; and at the head thereof, I beheld your mother Sariah, and Sam,  and Nephi; and they stood as if they knew not whither they should go.</p> <p>8:15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto  them, with a loud voice, that they should come unto me, and partake of the  fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.</p> <p>8:16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me, and partake of the fruit  also.</p> <p>8:17 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should  come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the head  of the river, that perhaps I might see them.</p> <p>8:18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come unto me.  8:19 And I beheld a rod of iron; and it extended along the bank of the river,  and led to the tree by which I stood.</p> <p>8:20 And I also beheld a straight and narrow path which came along by the rod  of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the  fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a world;</p> <p>8:21 and I saw numberless concourses of people; many of whom were pressing  forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which it  stood.</p> <p>8:22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path  which led to the tree.</p> <p>8:23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an  exceeding great mist of darkness, insomuch that they which had commenced in the  path, did lose their way, that they wandered off, and were lost.</p> <p>8:24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward; and they came  forth, and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron, and they did press through  the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come  forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. And after that</p> <p>they had partaken of the fruit of the tree,</p> <p>8:25 they did cast their eyes about as it they were ashamed.</p> <p>8:26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of  the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in  the air, high above the earth;</p> <p>8:27 and it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female;  and their number of dress was exceeding fine; and they were in the attitude of  mocking and pointing their fingers towards those which had come at, and were  partaking of the fruit.</p> <p>8:28 And after that they had tasted of the fruit, they were ashamed, because  of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths,  and were lost.</p> <p>8:29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.</p> <p>8:30 But to be short in writing: Behold, he saw other multitudes pressing  forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they  did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until  they came forth and fell down, and partook of the fruit of the tree.</p> <p>8:31 And he also saw other multitudes, feeling their way towards that great  and spacious building.</p> <p>8:32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the  fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads. 8:33 And  great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after  that they did enter into that building, they did point the finger of scorn at  me, and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.</p> <p>8:34 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them, had fallen  away.</p> <p>8:35 And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, saith my father.</p> <p>8:36 And it came to pass that after my father had spoken all the words of his  dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because of these things which  he saw in a vision. he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared  lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord;</p> <p>8:37 and he did not exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent,  that they would hearken to his words, in that, perhaps the Lord would be  merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them.</p> <p>8:38 And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of  many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and he did cease  speaking unto them.</p> <p>9:1 And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt  in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel; and also a great many more things, which  cannot be written upon these plates.</p> <p>9:2 And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold, they are not  the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people, I have  given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after  mine own name; and these plates also, are called the plates of Nephi.</p> <p>9:3 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord, that I should  make these plates, for the special purpose that there should be an account  engraven of the ministry of my people.</p> <p>9:4 Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign of the  Kings, and the wars, and contentions of my people; wherefore, these plates are,  for the more part, of the ministry; and the other plates are, for the more part,  of the reign of the Kings, and the wars, and the contentions of my people.</p> <p>9:5 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates, for a wise  purpose in him; which purpose, I know not.</p> <p>9:6 Behold the Lord knoweth all things, from the beginning; wherefore, he  prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for  behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is.  Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>10:1 And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates, of my  proceedings, and my reign and ministry; therefore, to proceed with mine account.  I must speak somewhat of the things of my father, and also of my brethren.</p> <p>10:2 For behold, it came to pass that after my father had made an end of  speaking the words of his dream, and also exhorting them to all diligence, he  spake unto them concerning the Jews:</p> <p>10:3 How that after they were destroyed, yea, even that great city Jerusalem;  and that many were carried away captive into Babylon; that according to the own  due time of the Lord, they should return again; yea, even be brought back out of  captivity; and after they are brought back out of captivity, to possess again  the land of their inheritance.</p> <p>10:4 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem,  a Prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews; yea, even a Messiah; or,  in other words, a Saviour of the world.</p> <p>10:5 And he also spake concerning the prophets: How great a number had  testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of which he had spoken, or  this Redeemer of the world.</p> <p>10:6 Wherefore, all mankind was in a lost and in a fallen state; and ever  would be, save they should rely on this Redeemer.</p> <p>10:7 And he spake also, concerning a prophet, which should come before the  Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord;</p> <p>10:8 yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness, Prepare ye the  way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you  whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not  worthy to unloose. And much spake my father concerning this thing.</p> <p>10:9 And my father saith that he should baptise in Bethabara, beyond Jordan;  and he also spake, that he should baptise with water. yea, even that he should  baptise the Messiah with water.</p> <p>10:10 And after that he had baptised the Messiah with water, he should behold  and bear record, that he had baptised the Lamb of God, which should take away  the sins of the world.</p> <p>10:11 And it came to pass that after my father had spoken these words, he  spake unto my brethren concerning the Gospel, which should be preached among the  Jews; and also, concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And after that  they had slain the Messiah which should come, and after that he had been slain,  he should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy  Ghost, unto the Gentiles.</p> <p>10:12 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also  concerning the House of Israel: that they should be compared like unto an olive  tree, whose branches should be broken off, and should be scattered upon all the  face of the earth.</p> <p>10:13 Wherefore, he said, it must needs be that we should be led with one  accord, into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of the Lord:  That we should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.</p> <p>10:14 And after that the house of Israel should be scattered, they should be  gathered together again; or, in fine, that after the Gentiles had received the  fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants  of the House of Israel, should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the  true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer.</p> <p>10:15 And after this manner of language did my father prophesy ,and speak  unto my brethren; and also, many more things, which I do not write in this book:  for I have written as many of them, as were expedient for me, in mine other  book:</p> <p>10:16 And all these things of which I have spoken, was done, as my father  dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.</p> <p>10:17 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of  my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision; and also the things  which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost; which power, he received by faith  on the Son of God. And the Son of God was the Messiah, which should come. And it  came to pass that I, Nephi, was desirous also, that I might see, and hear, and  know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God  unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old in the time that  he should manifest himself unto the children of men;</p> <p>10:18 for he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is  prepared from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come  unto him;</p> <p>10:19 for he that diligently seeketh, shall find; and the mysteries of God  shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these  times, as in times of old; and as well as in times of old, as in times to come;  wherefore, the courses of the Lord is one eternal round.</p> <p>10:20 Therefore, remember, O man, for all thy doings, thou shalt be brought  into judgment.</p> <p>10:21 Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly before the judgment seat of  God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off  forever.</p> <p>10:22 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these things,  and deny them not.</p> <p>11:1 For it came to pass that after I had desired to know the things that my  father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto  me; wherefore, as I sat pondering in mine heart, I was caught away in the spirit  of the Lord, yea, into an exceeding high mountain, which I, never had before  seen, and upon which I never had before sat my foot. 11:2 And the spirit saith  unto me, Behold, what desirest thou?</p> <p>11:3 And I saith, I desire to behold the things which my father saw.</p> <p>11:4 And the spirit saith unto me, Believest thou that thy father saw the  tree of which he hath spoken?</p> <p>11:5 And I said yea; thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.</p> <p>11:6 And when I had spoken these words, the spirit cried with a loud voice,  saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the  earth, yea, even above all; and blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest  in the Son of the Most High God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which  thou desired.</p> <p>11:7 And behold, this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign: that after  thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou  shalt also behold a man descending out of Heaven, and him shall ye witness; and  after that ye have witnessed him, ye shall bear record that it is the Son of  God.</p> <p>11:8 And it came to pass that the spirit saith unto me, look! and I looked  and beheld the tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and  the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the  whiteness thereof, did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.</p> <p>11:9 And it came to pass that after that I had seen the tree, I said unto the  spirit, I behold thou hast shewn unto me the tree which is precious above all.</p> <p>11:10 And he saith unto me, What desirest thou?</p> <p>11:11 And I said unto him, to know the interpretation thereof; for I spake  unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet,  nevertheless, I knew that it was the spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as  a man speaketh with another.</p> <p>11:12 And it came to pass that he said unto me, look: And I looked as if to  look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.</p> <p>11:13 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city Jerusalem,  and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of  Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceeding fair and white.</p> <p>11:14 And it came to pass that I saw the Heavens open; and an angel came down  and stood before me; and he saith unto me, Nephi, what beholdest thou?</p> <p>11:15 And I saith unto him, a virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other  virgins.</p> <p>11:16 And he saith unto me, Knowest thou condescention of God?</p> <p>11:17 And I said unto him, I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless,  I do not know the meaning of all things.</p> <p>11:18 And he said unto me, Behold, the virgin which thou seest, is the mother  of God, after the manner of flesh.</p> <p>11:19 And it came to pass I beheld that she was carried away in the spirit;  and after that she had been carried away in the spirit for the space of time,  the angel spake unto me, saying, look!</p> <p>11:20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.</p> <p>11:21 And the angel said unto me, behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the  Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</p> <p>11:22 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth  itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most  desirable above all things.</p> <p>11:23 And he spake unto me, saying, Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</p> <p>11:24 And after that he had said those words, he said unto me, look! And I  looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I  saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.</p> <p>11:25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron which my father  had seen, was the word of God, which let to the fountain of living waters, or to  the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I  also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.</p> <p>11:26 And the angel said unto me again, Look and behold the condescention of  God!</p> <p>11:27 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of which my father  had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet, which should prepare the way before  him. And the Lamb of God went forth, and was baptised of him; and after that he  was baptised, I beheld the Heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of  Heaven and abode upon him in the form of a dove.</p> <p>11:28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power  and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I  beheld that they cast him out from among them.</p> <p>11:29 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that  they were carried away in the spirit, from before my face, that I saw them not.</p> <p>11:30 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying, look!  And I looked, and I beheld the Heavens open again, and I saw angels descending  upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.</p> <p>11:31 And he spake unto me again, saying. look! And I looked, and beheld the  Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of  people which were sick, and which were afflicted of all manner of diseases, and  with devils, and unclean spirits; and the angel spake, and shewed all these  things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the  devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</p> <p>11:32 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying, look!  And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea,  the Everlasting God, was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.</p> <p>11:33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross, and slain for  the sins of the world.</p> <p>11:34 And after that he was slain, I saw the multitudes of the earth, that  they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus  were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.</p> <p>11:35 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that  they were in a large spacious building, like unto the building which my father  saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying, Behold the world and  the wisdom thereof; yea, behold, the House of Israel hath gathered together, to  fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p> <p>11:36 And it came to pass I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious  building was the pride of the world; and it fell; and the fall thereof was  exceeding great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus  shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that  shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p> <p>12:1 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me, Look, and behold thy  seed, and also the seed of thy brethren! And I looked and beheld the land of  promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea, even as it were in number, as  many as the sand of the sea.</p> <p>12:2 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together, to  battle one against the other; and I beheld wars, and rumors of wars, and great  slaughters with the sword among my people.</p> <p>12:3 And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away after the  manner of wars and contentions in the land; and I beheld many cities, yea, even  that I did not number them.</p> <p>12:4 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face of the  land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard thunderings, and earthquakes,  and all manner of tumultuous noises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that  rent; and I saw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the  earth. that they were broken up; and I saw many cities, that they were sunk; and  I saw many, that they were burned with fire; And I saw many, that they did  tumble to earth, because of the quaking thereof.</p> <p>12:5 And it came to pass that after I saw these things, I saw the vapor of  darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I saw the  multitudes which had fallen, because of the great and terrible judgments of the  Lord.</p> <p>12:6 And I saw the Heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of  Heaven; and he came down and shewed himself unto them.</p> <p>12:7 And I also saw and bear record, that the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve  others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.</p> <p>12:8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the twelve disciples of the  Lamb, which are chosen to minister unto thy seed.</p> <p>12:9 And he saith unto me, Thou remembereth the twelve apostles of the Lamb?  Behold, they are they which shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore,  the twelve ministers of thy seed, shall be judged of them; for ye are of the  house of Israel;</p> <p>12:10 and these twelve ministers which thou beholdest, shall judge thy seed.  And behold, they are righteous forever; for because of their faith in the Lamb  of God, their garments are made white in his blood.</p> <p>12:11 And the angel saith unto me, look! And I looked and beheld three  generations did pass away in righteousness; and their garments were white, even  like unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said unto me, These are made white in  the blood of the Lamb, because of their faith in him.</p> <p>12:12 And I, Nephi, also many of the fourth generation, which did pass away  in righteousness.</p> <p>12:13 And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes of the earth gathered  together.</p> <p>12:14 And the angel said unto me, Behold they seed, and also the seed of thy  brethren!</p> <p>12:15 And it came to pass that I looked, and beheld the people of my seed  gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my brethren; and they were  gathered together in battle.</p> <p>12:16 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of filthy  water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which he spake; and the  depths thereof, are the depths of hell;</p> <p>12:17 and the mists of darkness, are the temptations of the devil, which  blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth  them away into broad roads, that they may perish, and are lost;</p> <p>12:18 and the large and spacious building which thy father saw, is vain  imaginations, and the pride of the children of men. And a great and terrible  gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of the justice of the Eternal God, and  Jesus Christ, which is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record,  from the beginning of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth  and forever.</p> <p>12:19 And while the angel spoke these words, I beheld and saw that the seed  of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to the word of the angel;  and because of the pride of my seed, and the temptations of the devil, I beheld  that the seed of my brethren did overpower the people of my seed.</p> <p>12:20 And it came to pass that I beheld and saw the people of the seed of my  brethren, that they had overcome my seed; and they went forth in multitudes upon  the face of the land.</p> <p>12:21 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw wars, and  rumors of wars among them; and in wars, and rumors of wars, I saw many  generations pass away.</p> <p>12:22 And the angel said unto me, behold, these shall dwindle in unbelief.</p> <p>12:23 And it came to pass that I beheld that after they had dwindled in  unbelief, they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of  idleness and all manner of abominations.</p> <p>13:1 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me saying, look! And I  looked and beheld many nations and kingdoms.</p> <p>13:2 And the angel saith unto me, what beholdest thou? And I said I behold  many nations and kingdoms.</p> <p>13:3 And he saith unto me, these are the nations and kingdoms of the  Gentiles.</p> <p>13:4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the Gentiles, the  foundation of a great church.</p> <p>13:5 And the angel said unto me, Behold the foundation of a church, which is  most abominable above all churches, which slayeth the Saints of God, yea, and  tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and  bringeth them down into captivity.</p> <p>13:6 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and  I saw the devil, that he was the founder of it.</p> <p>13:7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and fine  twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many harlots.</p> <p>13:8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the silver,  and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine twined linen, and the precious  clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this great and abominable church:</p> <p>13:9 and also for the praise of the world, do they destroy the Saints of God,  and bring them down into captivity.</p> <p>13:10 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and they  divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren.</p> <p>13:11 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me, Behold, the wrath of  God is upon the seed of thy brethren!</p> <p>13:12 And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, which was separated  from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the spirit of God,  that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth among the many  waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, which were in the promised land.</p> <p>13:13 And it came to pass that I beheld the spirit of God, that it wrought  upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters.</p> <p>13:14 And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles, upon  the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of  my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles, and they were smitten.</p> <p>13:15 And I beheld the spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles;  that they did prosper, and obtain the land of their inheritance; and I beheld  that they were white, and exceeding fair and beautiful, like unto my people,  before they were slain.</p> <p>13:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles which had  gone forth out of captivity, did humble themselves before the Lord; and the  power of the Lord was with them;</p> <p>13:17 and I beheld that their mother Gentiles was gathered together upon the  waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them,</p> <p>13:18 and I beheld that the power of God was with them; and also, that the  wrath of God was upon them, that were gathered together against them to battle.</p> <p>13:19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles which had gone out of captivity,  were delivered by the power of God, out of the hands of all other nations.</p> <p>13:20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the  land, and I beheld a Book; and it was carried forth among them.</p> <p>13:21 And the angel saith unto me, Knowest thou the meaning of the Book?</p> <p>13:22 And I saith unto him, I know not.</p> <p>13:23 And he saith, Behold, it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew, and I,  Nephi, beheld it; and he saith unto me, The Book which thou beholdest, is a  record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord which he hath made  unto the House of Israel; and it also containeth many of the prophesies of the  Holy Prophets; and it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the  plates of brass, save there are not so many; nevertheless, they contain the  covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the House of Israel; wherefore,  they are of great worth unto the Gentiles.</p> <p>13:24 And the angel of the Lord said unto me, Thou hast beheld that the Book  proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it proceedeth from the mouth  of a Jew, it contained the plainness of the Gospel of the Lord, of whom the  twelve apostles bear record; and they bear record according to the truth which  is in the Lamb of God;</p> <p>13:25 wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity, unto the  Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God;</p> <p>13:26 and after that they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the  Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles; behold, after this, thou seest the  foundation of a great and abominable church, which is the most abominable above  all other churches; for behold, they have taken away from the Gospel of the  Lamb, many parts which are plain and most precious; and also, many Covenants of  the Lord have they taken away;</p> <p>13:27 and all this have they done, that they might pervert the right ways of  the Lord; that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children  of men;</p> <p>13:28 wherefore, thou seest that after the Book hath gone forth through the  hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and precious  things taken away from the Book, which is the Book of the Lamb of God;</p> <p>13:29 and after that these plain and precious things were taken away, it  goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto  all the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even across the many waters which thou  hast seen with the Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity; and thou  seest because of the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of  the Book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children of men,  according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of God; and because of these  things which were taken away out of the Gospel of the Lamb, an exceeding great  many do stumble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath great power over them;</p> <p>13:30 nevertheless thou beholdest that the Gentiles which have gone forth out  of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of God above all other  nations upon the face of the Land, which is choice above all other lands, which  is the land which the Lord God hath covenanted with thy father, that his seed  should have, for the land of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the  Lord God will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the mixture of  thy seed, which is among thy brethren;</p> <p>13:31 neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the seed of thy  brethren;</p> <p>13:32 neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain  in that state of awful woundedness which thou beholdest that they are in,  because of the plain and most precious parts of the Gospel of the Lamb which  hath been kept back by the abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen;</p> <p>13:33 wherefore, saith the Lamb of God, I will be merciful unto the Gentiles,  unto the visiting of the remnant of the House of Israel in great judgment.</p> <p>13:34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying:  Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after that I have visited the remnant of the  House of Israel, and this remnant of which I speak, is the seed of thy father;  wherefore, after that I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the  hand of the Gentiles; and after that the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly,  because of the most plain and precious parts of the Gospel of the Lamb which  hath been kept back, by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots,  saith the Lamb; wherefore, I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day,  saith the Lamb, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them in mine own power,  much of my Gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb;</p> <p>13:35 for behold, saith the Lamb, I will manifest myself unto thy seed, that  they shall write many things which I shall minister unto them, which shall be  plain and precious; and after that thy seed shall be destroyed and dwindle in  unbelief, and also, the seed of thy brethren; behold, these things shall be hid  up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb;</p> <p>13:36 and in them shall be written my Gospel, saith the Lamb, and my rock and  my salvation;</p> <p>13:37 and blessed are they which shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that  day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they  endure unto the end, they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved  in the Everlasting Kingdom of the Lamb; yea, whoso shall publish peace, that  shall publish tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they  be.</p> <p>13:38 And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my  brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had proceeded forth from  the mouth of the Jew; and I beheld that it came forth from the Gentiles, unto  the remnant of the seed of my brethren;</p> <p>13:39 and after it had come forth unto them, I beheld other Books, which came  forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles, unto them, unto the  convincing of the Gentiles, and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also  to the Jews, which were scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the  records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, are true.</p> <p>13:40 And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records which thou hast  seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which is of the  twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things  which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds,  tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Eternal Father and the Saviour  of the world; and that all men must come unto Him, or they cannot be saved;</p> <p>13:41 and they must come according to the words which shall be established by  the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the  records of thy seed, as well as in the records of the twelve apostles of the  Lamb; wherefore, they shall be established in one, for there is one God and one  Shepherd over all the earth;</p> <p>13:42 and the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all nations,  both unto the Jews, and also unto the Gentiles; and after that he hath  manifested himself unto the Jews, and also unto the Gentiles, then he shall  manifest himself unto the Gentiles, and also unto the Jews, and the last shall  be first, and the first shall be last.</p> <p>14:1 And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken unto the  Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself unto them in word, and  also in power, in very deed, unto the taking away of their stumbling blocks, if  it so be that they harden not their hearts against the Lamb;</p> <p>14:2 and if it so be that they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of  God, they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall be  numbered among the House of Israel; and they shall be a blest people upon the  promised land forever; they shall be no more brought down into captivity; and  the House of Israel shall no more be confounded;</p> <p>14:3 and that great pit which hath been digged for them, by that great and  abominable church, which was founded by the Devil and his children, that he  might lead away the souls of men down to Hell; yea, the great pit which hath  been digged for the destruction of men, shall be filled by those who digged it,  unto their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the  soul, save it be the casting of it into that Hell which hath no end;</p> <p>14:4 for behold, this is according to the captivity of the Devil, and also  according to the justice of God, upon all those who will work wickedness and  abomination before him.</p> <p>14:5 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying: Thou  hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent, it shall be well with them; and thou  also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the House of Israel; and  thou also hast heard, that whoso repenteth not, must perish;</p> <p>14:6 therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles, if it so be that they harden their  hearts against the Lamb of God:</p> <p>14:7 for the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and  a marvellous work among the children of men; a work which shall be everlasting,  either on the one hand or on the other; either to the convincing of them unto  peace and life eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their  hearts and the blindness of their minds, unto their being brought down into  captivity, and also unto destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according  to the captivity of the Devil, of which I have spoken.</p> <p>14:8 And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words, he saith  unto me, Remember thou the covenants of the Father unto the House of Israel? I  saith unto ,him, yea.</p> <p>14:9 And it came to pass that he saith unto me, Look, and beheld that great  and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose foundation is  the devil.</p> <p>14:10 And he saith unto me, Behold, there is, save it be, two churches: the  one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the Devil;  wherefore. whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God, belongeth to  that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of  all the earth.</p> <p>14:11 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the  earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the earth,  among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.</p> <p>14:12 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and  its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore  which sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb,  which were the Saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and  their dominion upon the face of the earth was small, because of the wickedness  of the great whore which I saw.</p> <p>14:13 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations  did gather together multitudes upon the face of the earth, among all the nations  of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God. And it came to pass that I,  Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God,</p> <p>14:14 that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon  the covenant people of the Lord, which were scattered upon all the face of the  earth; and they were warned with righteousness and with the power of God in  great glory.</p> <p>14:15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out  upon the great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors  of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth;</p> <p>14:16 and as there began to be wars and rumors of war among all the nations  which belongeth to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me saying:  Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest  all these things!</p> <p>14:17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the  mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth,  whose founder is the Devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall  commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he  hath made to his people, which are of the House of Israel.</p> <p>14:18 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying, Look!</p> <p>14:19 And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe;</p> <p>14:20 and the angel said unto me, Behold one of the twelve Apostles of the  Lamb!</p> <p>14:21 Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things; yea, and  also many things which have been;</p> <p>14:22 and he shall also write concerning the end of the world;</p> <p>14:23 wherefore, the things which he shall write, are just and true; and,  behold, they are written in the book which thou beheld proceeding out of the  mouth of the Jew; and at the time proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at  the time the book proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were  written, were plain and pure, and most precious, and easy to the understanding  of all men.</p> <p>14:24 And, behold, the things which the Apostle of the Lamb shall write, are  many things which thou hast seen; and, behold, the remainder shalt thou see;</p> <p>14:25 but the things which thou shalt see hereafter, thou shalt not write;  for the Lord God hath ordained the Apostle of the Lamb of God, that he should  write them.</p> <p>14:26 And also, others which have been to them, hath he shown all things, and  they have written them; and they are sealed up, to come forth in their purity,  according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord,  unto the House of Israel.</p> <p>14:27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the Apostle of  the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.</p> <p>14:28 And, behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder  of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore, the things which I have written,  sufficeth me; and I have not written but a small part of the things which I saw.</p> <p>14:29 And I bear record, that I saw the things which my father saw, and the  angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.</p> <p>14:30 And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw,  while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are  not written, the things which I have written are true. And thus it is. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>15:1 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away in the  spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the ten of my father.</p> <p>15:2 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were disputing  one with another, concerning the things which my father had spoken unto them;</p> <p>15:3 for he truly spake many great things unto them, which was hard to be  understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their  hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they had ought.</p> <p>15:4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their hearts,  and also, because of the things which I had seen, and knew they must unavoidably  come to pass, because of the great wickedness of the children of men.</p> <p>15:5 And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my afflictions, for I  considered that mine afflictions were great above all, because of the  destruction of my people; for I had beheld their fall.</p> <p>15:6 And it came to pass that after I had received strength, I spake unto my  brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their disputations.</p> <p>15:7 And they said, Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father  hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive tree, and also,  concerning the Gentiles.</p> <p>15:8 And I said unto them, Have ye inquired of the Lord?</p> <p>15:9 And they said unto me, we have not; for the Lord maketh no such things  known unto us.</p> <p>15:10 Behold, I said unto them, How is it ye do not keep the commandments of  the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?  Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said: If ye will not harden  your hearts,</p> <p>15:11 and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in  keeping my commandments, surely, these things shall be made known unto you?  Behold, I say unto you,</p> <p>15:12 that the House of Israel was compared unto an olive tree, by the spirit  of the Lord which was in our fathers; and, behold, are we not broken off from  the House of Israel; and are we not a branch of the House of Israel?</p> <p>15:13 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in  of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the  latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space  of many years, and many generations, after that the Messiah hath manifested  himself in body unto the children of men, then shall the fullness of the Gospel  of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of  our seed;</p> <p>15:14 and at that day, shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of  the House of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then  shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the  knowledge of the Gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their  fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer,  and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and  be saved.</p> <p>15:15 And then at that day, will they not rejoice and give praise unto their  everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not  receive the strength and nourishment from the true vine? Yea, will they not come  unto the true fold of God?</p> <p>15:16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea, they shall be remembered again among the  House of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive  tree, into the true olive tree;</p> <p>15:17 and this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not  come to pass, until after that they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he  meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may shew his  power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he shall be rejected of the  Jews, or of the House of Israel;</p> <p>15:18 wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of  all the House of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in  the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In  they seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p> <p>15:19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them concerning  these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the restoration of the Jews, in  the latter days;</p> <p>15:20 and I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, which spake  concerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the House of Israel; and after  that they were restored, they should no more be confounded, neither should they  be scattered again. And it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my  brethren, that they were pacified, and did humble themselves before the Lord.</p> <p>15:21 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again, saying: What  meaneth the thing which our father saw in a dream? What meaneth the tree which  he saw?</p> <p>15:22 And I said unto them, it was a representation of the tree of life.</p> <p>15:23 And they said unto me, What meaneth the rod of iron which our father  saw, that led to the tree?</p> <p>15:24 And I said unto them, that it was the word of God; and whoso would  hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never  perish; neither could the temptations and the firy darts of the adversary,  overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</p> <p>15:25 Wherefore I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the  Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the  faculty which I possessed that they would give heed to the word of God, and  remember to keep his commandments always, in all things.</p> <p>15:26 And they said unto me, What meaneth the river of water which our father  saw?</p> <p>15:27 And I said unto them, that the water which my father saw, was  filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things, that he  beheld not the filthiness of the water;</p> <p>15:28 and I said unto them, that it was an awful gulf, which separateth the  wicked from the tree of life, and also from the Saints of God;</p> <p>15:29 and I said unto them, that it was a representation of that awful Hell,  which the angel said unto me was prepared for the wicked.</p> <p>15:30 And I said unto them, that our father also saw, that the justice of God  did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and the brightness thereof was  like unto the brightness of a flaming fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever  and ever, and hath no end.</p> <p>15:31 And they said unto me, Doth this thing mean the torment of the body in  the days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the soul after the  death of the temporal body? or doth it speak of the things which are temporal?</p> <p>15:32 And it came to pass that I said unto them, That it was a representation  of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day should come that they must be  judged of their works, yea, even the works which were done by the temporal body  in their days of probation;</p> <p>15:33 wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness, they must be cast  off; also as to the things which are spiritual, which are pertaining to  righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God to be judged  of their works; and if their works have been filthiness, they must needs be  filthy; and if they be filthy, it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the  kingdom of God; if so, The kingdom of God must be filthy also.</p> <p>15:34 But behold, I say unto you, The kingdom of God is not filthy, and there  cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore, there must  needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.</p> <p>15:35 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful Hell of which I  have spoken, and the Devil is the preparator of it; wherefore, the final state  of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out because  of that justice of which I have spoken;</p> <p>15:36 wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and also from  that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and most desirable above all  other fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I  spake unto my brethren. Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>16:1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking  to my brethren, behold, they said unto me, Thou hast declared unto us hard  things, more than that which we are able to bear.</p> <p>16:2 And it came to pass that I said unto them, That I knew that I had spoken  hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I  justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day;  wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the  very centre.</p> <p>16:3 And now, my brethren, if ye were righteous, and were willing to hearken  to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God,  then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say thou speaketh hard things  against us.</p> <p>16:4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren, with all  diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.</p> <p>16:5 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord;  insomuch, that I had joy and great hopes for them, that they would walk in the  paths of righteousness.</p> <p>16:6 Now all these things were said and done, as my father dwelt in a tent in  the valley which he called Lemuel.</p> <p>16:7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters of Ishmael  to wife; and also my brethren took of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and  also, Zoram took the eldest daghter of Ishmael to wife.</p> <p>16:8 And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the Lord, which  had been given unto him. And also, I Nephi, had been blessed of the Lord,  exceedingly.</p> <p>16:9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my father, by  night, and commanded him, that on the morrow, he should take his journey into  the wilderness.</p> <p>16:10 And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, and went  forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment, he beheld upon the ground a  round ball, of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the  ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither we should go into  the wilderness.</p> <p>16:11 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever things we  should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of our provisions which  the Lord had given unto us; and we did take seed of every kind, that we might  carry into the wilderness.</p> <p>16:12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents, and depart into the  wilderness, across the river Laman.</p> <p>16:13 And it came to pass that we travelled for the space of four days,  nearly a south, southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents again; and we  did call the name of the place Shazer.</p> <p>16:14 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows, and go  forth into the wilderness, to slay food for our families; and after that we had  slain food for our families, we did return again to our families in the  wilderness, to the place of Shazer. And we did go forth again in the wilderness,  following the same direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the  wilderness, which was in the borders near the Red Sea,</p> <p>16:15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days,  slaying food by the way, with our bows and arrows, and our stones, and our  slings;</p> <p>16:16 and we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in more  fertile parts of the wilderness.</p> <p>16:17 And after that we had travelled for the space of many days, we did  pitch our tents, for the space of a time, that we might again rest ourselves and  obtain food for our families.</p> <p>16:18 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold,  I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel; and after that I did break my  bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me, because of the loss of my bow, for  we did obtain no food.</p> <p>16:19 And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families.  And being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they did suffer much for  want of food.</p> <p>16:20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, did  begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings and afflictions in the  wilderness; and also, my father began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea,  and they were all exceeding sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the  Lord.</p> <p>16:21 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with my  brethren, because of the loss of my bow; and their bows having lost their  springs, it began to be exceeding difficult, yea, insomuch, that we could obtain  no food.</p> <p>16:22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my brethren,  because that they had hardened their hearts again, even unto complaining against  the Lord their God.</p> <p>16:23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out  of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and arrow,  with a sling, and with stones. And I said unto my father, Whither shall I go, to  obtain food?</p> <p>16:24 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had  humbled themselves because of my word; for I did say many things unto them in  the energy of my soul.</p> <p>16:25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and  he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord; insomuch, that  he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.</p> <p>16:26 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him, Look on  the ball, and behold the things which are written!</p> <p>16:27 And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things which were  written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble exceedingly; and also my  brethren, and the sons of Ishmael, and our wives.</p> <p>16:28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in  the ball, that they did work according to the faith, and diligence, and heed,  which we did give unto them.</p> <p>16:29 And there was also written upon them, a new writing, which was plain to  read, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it  was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence  which we gave unto it: And thus we see, that by small means, the Lord can bring  about great things.</p> <p>16:30 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the  mountain, according to the directions which were given upon the ball.</p> <p>16:31 And it came to pass that I did slay beasts, insomuch, that I did obtain  food for our families.</p> <p>16:32 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the beasts  which I had slain; and now, when they beheld that I had obtained food, how great  was their joy. And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the  Lord, and did give thanks unto him.</p> <p>16:33 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, travelling  nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after that we had travelled for  the space of many days, we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for  the space of a time.</p> <p>16:34 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the place  which was called Nahom.</p> <p>16:35 And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn  exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of their  afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because he  had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea,  and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much  afflictions, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings, we  must perish in the wilderness with hunger.</p> <p>16:36 And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and  they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.</p> <p>16:37 And Laman saith unto Lemuel, and also unto the sons of Ishmael, Behold,  let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who hath taken it upon him  to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren.</p> <p>16:38 Now, he saith that the Lord hath talked with him, and also, that angels  hath ministered unto him! But behold, we know that he lieth unto us; and he  telleth us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he  may deceive our eyes, thinking, that he may lead us away into some strange  wilderness; and after that he hath led us away, he hath thought to make himself  a King and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and  pleasure. And after this manner, did my brother Laman stir up their hearts to  anger.</p> <p>16:39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us; yea, even the voice of  the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did chasten them  exceedingly; and after that they were chastened by the voice of the Lord, they  did turn away their anger, and did repent of their sins, insomuch, that the Lord  did bless us again with food, that we did not perish.</p> <p>17:1 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the  wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward, from that time forth. And we did  travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did  bear children in the wilderness.</p> <p>17:2 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did  live upon the raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for  their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to  bear the journeyings without murmurings.</p> <p>17:3 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if  it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God, he doth nourish  them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the  thing which he hath commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while  we did sojourn in the wilderness.</p> <p>17:4 And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even eight years in  the wilderness.</p> <p>17:5 And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because of its  much fruit, and also, wild honey; and all these things were prepared of the  Lord, that we might not perish. And we beheld the Sea, which we called  Irreantum, which being interpreted, is, many waters.</p> <p>17:6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore; and  notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even  so much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came  to the seashore; and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.</p> <p>17:7 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of  Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me,  saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountains. And it came to pass that I arose  and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.</p> <p>17:8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt  construct a ship, after the manner which I shall shew thee, that I may carry thy  people across these waters.</p> <p>17:9 And I saith, Lord, whither shall I go. that I may find ore to molten,  that I may make tools to construct the ship, after the manner which thou hast  shewn unto me?</p> <p>17:10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find  ore, that I might make tools.</p> <p>17:11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make bellowses wherewith to blow  the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after that I had made bellowses, that I  might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together, that I  might make fire;</p> <p>17:12 for the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire,  as we journied in the wilderness; for he saith, I will make that thy food shall  become sweet, that ye cook it not;</p> <p>17:13 and I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the  way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore,  inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall be led towards the promised  land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led.</p> <p>17:14 Yea, and the Lord said also, that after ye have arrived to the promised  land, ye shall know that I the Lord, am God; and that I, the Lord, did deliver  you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem;</p> <p>17:15 wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of the Lord,  and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence.</p> <p>17:16 And it came to pass that I did make the tools of the ore which I did  molten out of rock.</p> <p>17:17 And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began  to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can  build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.</p> <p>17:18 And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that  they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship;  neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord.</p> <p>17:19 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceeding sorrowful, because  of the hardness of their hearts; and now when they saw that I began to be  sorrowful, they were glad in their hearts, insomuch, that they did rejoice over  me, saying: We knew that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were  lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so great a work;</p> <p>17:20 and thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations  of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem; and we have  wandered, in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled,  being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness, and  suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they  had died, before they came out of Jerusalem, than to have suffered these  afflictions.</p> <p>17:21 Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness, which time  we might have enjoyed our possessions, and the land of our inheritance; yea, and  we might have been happy;</p> <p>17:22 and we know that the people which were in the land of Jerusalem, were a  righteous people; for they kept the statues and the judgments of the Lord, and  all his commandments, according to the law of Moses; wherefore, we know that  they are a righteous people; and our father hath judged them, and hath led us  away because we would hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto  him. And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur and complain  against us.</p> <p>17:23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do ye  believe that our fathers, which were the children of Israel, would have been led  away out of the hands of the Egyptians, if they had not hearkened unto the words  of the Lord?</p> <p>17:24 Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage, if the  Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead them out of bondage?</p> <p>17:25 Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and ye know  that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, ye  know that it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought  out of bondage.</p> <p>17:26 Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great work;  and ye know that by his word, the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and  thither, and they passed through on dry ground.</p> <p>17:27 But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, which were  the armies of Pharaoh;</p> <p>17:28 and ye also know that they were fed with manna, in the wilderness;</p> <p>17:29 yea, and ye also know that Moses by his word, according to the power of  God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth water, that the  children of Israel might quench their thirst;</p> <p>17:30 and notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer,  going before them, leading them by day, and giving light unto them by night, and  doing all things for them which was expedient for man to receive, they hardened  their hearts, and blinded their minds, and prevailed</p> <p>against Moses and against the true and living God.</p> <p>17:31 And it came to pass that according to his word, he did destroy them;  and according to his word, he did lead them; and according to his word, he did  do all things for them; and there was not anything done, save it were by his  word.</p> <p>17:32 And after they had crossed the river Jordan, he did make them mighty,  unto the driving out the children of the land, yea, unto the scattering them to  destruction.</p> <p>17:33 And now do ye suppose that the children of this land, which were in the  land of promise, which were driven out by our fathers, do ye suppose that they  were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, nay.</p> <p>17:34 Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice than they,  if they had been righteous? I say unto you, nay,</p> <p>17:35 behold the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one: He that is righteous, is  favored of God. But, behold, this people had rejected every word of God, and the  were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and  the Lord did curse them; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless  it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction;  and he did bless it unto our fathers, unto obtaining power over it.</p> <p>17:36 Behold, the Lord hath created the earth, that it should be inhabited;  and he hath created his children, that they should possess it.</p> <p>17:37 And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the nations of the  wicked.</p> <p>17:38 And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked  he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for their sakes.</p> <p>17:39 He ruleth high in the Heavens, for it is his throne, and the earth is  his footstool.</p> <p>17:40 And he loveth them which will have him to be their God. Behold, he  loveth our fathers; and he covenanted with them, yea, even Abraham, Isaac, and  Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did  bring them out of the land of Egypt,</p> <p>17:41 and he did straighten them in the wilderness with his rod, for they  hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straightened them, because  of their iniquity. He sent firy-flying serpents among them; and after they were  bitten, he prepared a way, that they might be healed; and the labor which they  had to perform, was to look! and because of the simpleness of the way, or the  easiness of it, there were many which perished.</p> <p>17:42 And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did revile  against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye know that they were led  forth by his matchless power, into the land of promise.</p> <p>17:43 And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have  become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but they are at this  day about to be destroyed, for I know that the day must surely come, that they  must be destroyed, save a few only, which shall be led away into captivity.</p> <p>17:44 wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart into the  wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life; yea, and ye also  have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts,  and ye are like unto they:</p> <p>17:45 Ye are swift to do iniquity, but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye  have seen the angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from  time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still, small voice, but ye were  past feeling, that ye could not feel his words; wherefore, he hath spoken unto  you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it  were to divide asunder.</p> <p>17:46 And ye also know, that by the power of his almighty word, he can cause  the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by his word, he can  cause the rough places be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O,  then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts?</p> <p>17:47 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my heart is  pained: I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever. Behold, I am full of the  spirit of God, insomuch as if my frame had no strength.</p> <p>17:48 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words, they were  angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the depths of the Sea; and as  they came forth to lay their hands upon me, I spake unto them saying: In the  name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled  with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay  their hands upon me, shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as  nought before the power of God, for God shall smite him.</p> <p>17:49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, saith unto them, That they should  murmur no more against their father; neither should they withhold their labor  from me, for God had commanded me that I should build a ship.</p> <p>17:50 And I saith unto them, If God had commanded me to do all things, I  could do it. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, Be thou  earth; and if I should say it, it would be done.</p> <p>17:51 And now, if the Lord hath such great power, and hath wrought so many  miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I  should build a ship?</p> <p>17:52 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my brethren,  insomuch that they were confounded, and could not contend against me; neither  durst they lay their hands upon me, nor touch me with their fingers, even for  the space of many days. Now they durst not do this, lest they should wither  before me, so powerful was the spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon them.</p> <p>17:53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me, Stretch forth thine  hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither before thee, but I will  shock them, saith the Lord; and this will I do, that they may know that I am the  Lord their God.</p> <p>17:54 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my brethren,  and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did shake them, even according  to the word which he had spoken.</p> <p>17:55 And now, they said, We know of a surety, that the Lord is with thee,  for we know that it is the power of the Lord that hath shaken us. And they fell  down before me, and were about to worship me, but I would not suffer them,  saying: I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the  Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in  the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.</p> <p>18:1 And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth  with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did shew  me from time to time, after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship.</p> <p>18:2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was  learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did  build it after the manner which the Lord had shewn unto me; wherefore, it was  not after the manner of men.</p> <p>18:3 And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the  Lord; wherefore, the Lord shewed unto me great things.</p> <p>18:4 And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship according to the  word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was good, and that the workmanship  thereof was exceeding fine; wherefore, they did humble themselves again before  the Lord.</p> <p>18:5 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father, that  we should arise and go down into the ship.</p> <p>18:6 And it came to pass that on the morrow, after that we had prepared all  things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in abundance, and  provisions, according to that which the Lord had commanded us, we did go down  into the ship with all our loading and our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had  brought with us, every one according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down  into the ship, with our wives and our children.</p> <p>18:7 And now, my father had begat two sons, in the wilderness: The eldest was  called Jacob, and the younger, Joseph.</p> <p>18:8 And it came to pass that after we had all gone down into the ship, and  had taken with us our provisions and things which had been commanded us, we did  put forth into the sea, and were driven forth before the wind, towards the  promised land;</p> <p>18:9 and after that we had been driven forth before the wind, for the space  of many days, behold, my brethren, and the sons of Ishmael, and also their  wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to  sing, and to speak with much rudeness, yea, even to that they did forget by what  power they had been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding  rudeness.</p> <p>18:10 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly, lest the Lord should be angry  with us, and smite us, because of our iniquity, that we should be swallowed up  in the depths of the Sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with much  soberness; but, behold they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our  younger brother shall be a ruler over us.</p> <p>18:11 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with  cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did  suffer it, that he might shew forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word  which he hath spoken, concerning the wicked.</p> <p>18:12 And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I could  not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord, did cease to work;</p> <p>18:13 wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch,  that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest; and we were  driven back upon the waters for the space of three days; and they began to be  frightened exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the Sea; nevertheless,  they did loose me not.</p> <p>18:14 And on the fourth day which we had been driven back, the tempest began  to be exceeding sore.</p> <p>18:15 And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths  of the Sea. And after that we had been driven back upon the waters for the space  of four days, my brethren began to see that the judgment of God was upon them,  and that they must perish, save that they should repent of their iniquities;  wherefore, they came unto me and loosed the bands which was upon my wrists, and  behold, they had much swollen, exceedingly; and also, mine ancles were much  swollen, and great was the soreness thereof.</p> <p>18:16 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day  long; and I did not murmur against the Lord, because of mine afflictions.</p> <p>18:17 Now, my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also unto the  sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much threatnings against any  one that should speak for me; and my parents being stricken in years, and having  suffered much grief because of their children, they were brought down, yea, even  unto their sick beds.</p> <p>18:18 Because of their grief, and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my  brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of this time, to meet  their God; yea, their gray hairs were about to be brought down to lie low in the  dust; Yea, even they were near to be cast into a watery grave.</p> <p>18:19 And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much  nourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their mother; and also  my wife, with her tears and prayers, and also my children, did not soften the  hearts of my brethren, that they would loose me;</p> <p>18:20 and there was nothing, save it were the power of God, which threatened  them with destruction, could soften their hearts; wherefore, when they saw that  they were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea, they repented to  the thing which they had done, insomuch that they loosed me.</p> <p>18:21 And it came to pass that after they had loosed me, behold, I took the  compass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass that I prayed  unto the Lord; and after that I had prayed, the winds did cease, and the storm  did cease, and there was a great calm.</p> <p>18:22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed  again toward the promised land.</p> <p>18:23 And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many  days, we did arrive to the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and  did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land.</p> <p>18:24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began  to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had  brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that they did grow  exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance.</p> <p>18:25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the Land of Promise, as we  journied in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind,  both the cow, and the ox, and the ass, and the horse, and the goat, and the wild  goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were used for the use of men. And we  did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper.</p> <p>19:1 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make  plates of ore, that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon  the plates which I made, I did engraven the record of my father, and also our  journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also, many  of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.</p> <p>19:2 And I knew not at that time when I made them, that I should be commanded  of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the  genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the  wilderness, are engraven upon those plates of which I have spoken; wherefore,  the things which transpired before that I made these plates, are of a truth,  more particularly made mention upon the first plates.</p> <p>19:3 And after that I made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi,  received a commandment, that the ministry, and the prophecies, the more plain  and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the  things which were written, should be kept for the instruction of my people,  which should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes,  are known unto the Lord;</p> <p>19:4 wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which  gives an account, or which gives a greater account, of the wars, and  contentions, and destructions of my people. And this I have done, and commanded  my people that they should do, after that I was gone, and that these plates  should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to  another, until further commandments of the Lord.</p> <p>19:5 And an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter; and  then behold, I proceed according to that which I have spoken; and this I do,  that the more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people.</p> <p>19:6 Nevertheless, I do not write any thing upon the plates, save it be that  I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old. Not that I  would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the weakness which is  in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself.</p> <p>19:7 For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the  body and soul, others set at nought, and trample under their feet. Yea, even the  very God of Israel, do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their  feet; but I would speak in other words: They do set him at nought, and hearken  not to the voice of his counsels;</p> <p>19:8 and behold, he cometh according to the words of the angel, in six  hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem:</p> <p>19:9 And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing  of nought; wherefore, they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him,  and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of  his loving kindness and his long suffering towards the children of men.</p> <p>19:10 And the God of our fathers, which were led out of Egypt, out of  bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him; yea, the God of  Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself according to the  words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up  according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of  Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, and according to the words of Zenos,  which he spake, concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign  given of his death, unto them who should inhabit the isles of the sea; more  especially given unto them which are of the House of Israel.</p> <p>19:11 For thus spake the Prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit the House  of Israel at that day: some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto  their great joy and salvation; and others with the thunderings and lightnings of  his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapour of darkness, and by the  opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up;</p> <p>19:12 and all these things must surely come, saith the Prophet Zenos. And the  rocks of the earth must rend; and because the groanings of the earth, many of  the Kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon by the spirit of God, to  exclaim, The God of nature suffers.</p> <p>19:13 And as for they which are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet, shall be  scourged by all people, saith the prophet, because they crucify the God of  Israel, and turned their hearts aside, rejecting signs, and wonders, and power  and glory of the God of Israel;</p> <p>19:14 and because they turned their hearts aside, saith the prophet, and have  despised the Holy one of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and  become a hiss and a by-word, and be hated among all nations;</p> <p>19:15 nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they no  more turn aside their hearts against the Holy one of Israel, then will he  remember the covenants which he made to their fathers;</p> <p>19:16 yea, then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all the  people which are of the House of Israel, will I gather in, saith the Lord,  according to the words of the Prophet Zenos, from the four quarters of the  earth;</p> <p>19:17 yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord, saith the  prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, shall be blessed.</p> <p>19:18 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that perhaps I  might persuade them that they would remember the Lord their Redeemer;</p> <p>19:19 wherefore, I speak unto all the House of Israel, if it so be that they  should obtain these things.</p> <p>19:20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary me, even  that all my joints are weak, for they which are at Jerusalem; for had not the  Lord been merciful, to shew unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of  old;</p> <p>19:21 for he surely did shew unto the prophets of old, all things concerning  them; and also, he did shew unto many, concerning us; wherefore, it must needs  be, that we know concerning them, for they are written upon the plates of brass.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>19:22 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren these things.  And it came to pass that I did read many things to them, which were engraven  upon the plates of brass, that they might know concerning the doings of the Lord  in other lands, among people of old.</p> <p>19:23 And I did read many things unto them, which were written in the Book of  Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their  Redeemer, wherefore I did read unto them that which was written by the Prophet  Isaiah; for I did liken all the scriptures unto us, that it might be for our  profit and learning.</p> <p>19:24 Wherefore, I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the prophet,  ye which are a remnant of the House of Israel, a branch of which have been  broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which was written unto all the  House of Israel, and liken it unto yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as  your brethren, from whom ye have broken off. For after this manner hath the  prophet written:</p> <p>20:1 Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of  Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name  of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel; yet they swear not in truth,  nor righteousness.</p> <p>20:2 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the Holy city, but they do not  stay themselves upon the God of Israel, which is the Lord of hosts; yea, the  Lord of hosts is his name.</p> <p>20:3 Behold, I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they  went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did shew them suddenly.</p> <p>20:4 And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck was an  iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</p> <p>20:5 and I have, even from the beginning, declared to thee; before it came to  pass I shewed them thee; and I shewed them for fear lest thou shouldst say, Mine  idol hath done them; and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded  them.</p> <p>20:6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them? And  that I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou  didst not know them.</p> <p>20:7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day  when thou heardest them not, they were declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst  say, Behold, I knew them.</p> <p>20:8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time,  thine ear was not opened: for I know that thou wouldst deal very treacherously,  and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</p> <p>20:9 Nevertheless, for my name sake I will defer mine anger, and for my  praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off.</p> <p>20:10 For behold, I have refined thee; I have chosen thee in the furnace of  affliction.</p> <p>20:11 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake, will I do this; for I will  not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory unto another.</p> <p>20:12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; for I am he; and I am  the first, and I am also the last.</p> <p>20:13 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand  hath spanned the heavens: and I called unto them, and they stand up together.</p> <p>20:14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared  these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him: yea, and he will fulfill his  word which he hath declared by them; and he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and  his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans.</p> <p>20:15 Also, saith the Lord: I the Lord, yea, I have spoken, yea, I have  called him, to declare I have brought him; and he shall make his way prosperous.</p> <p>20:16 Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning;  from the time that it was declared, have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his  spirit, hath sent me.</p> <p>20:17 And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel I have  sent him, the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by  the way thou shouldst go, hath done it.</p> <p>20:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been  as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;</p> <p>20:19 thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels like  the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from  before me.</p> <p>20:20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of  singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord  hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</p> <p>20:21 And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts: he caused the  waters to flow out of the rock for them: he cleaved the rock also, and the  waters gushed out.</p> <p>20:22 And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also, There is  no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.</p> <p>21:1 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and  are driven out, because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all  ye that are broken off, that are scattered abroad, which are of my people, O  house of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The  Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made  mention of my name.</p> <p>21:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand  hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;</p> <p>21:3 and said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be  glorified.</p> <p>21:4 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for  nought, and in vain; surely, my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my  God.</p> <p>21:5 And now, saith the Lord, that formed me from the womb that I should be  his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet  shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.</p> <p>21:6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to  raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will  also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation  unto the ends of the earth.</p> <p>21:7 Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom  man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to servants of rulers, Kings  shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is  faithful.</p> <p>21:8 Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O isles of  the sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee,  and give thee my servant for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth,  to cause to inherit the desolate heritages:</p> <p>21:9 that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that sit in  darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall  be in all high places.</p> <p>21:10 They shall not hunger or thirst, neither shall the heat or the sun  smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs  of water shall he guide them.</p> <p>21:11 And I will make all my mountains away, and my highways shall be  exalted.</p> <p>21:12 And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo,  these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</p> <p>21:13 Sing, O Heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of them which are  in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for  they shall be smitten no more: for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will  have mercy upon his afflicted.</p> <p>21:14 But, behold, Zion hath said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord  hath forgotten me; but he will shew that he hath not.</p> <p>21:15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have  compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget  thee, O house of Israel.</p> <p>21:16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are  continually before me.</p> <p>21:17 Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and they that  made thee waste, shall go forth of thee.</p> <p>21:18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves  together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt  surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even as  a bride.</p> <p>21:19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction,  shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that  swallowed thee up, shall be far away.</p> <p>21:20 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other,  shall again in thine ears say, The place is too straight for me: give place to  me that I may dwell.</p> <p>21:21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing  I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro?  and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they  been?</p> <p>21:22 Thus saith the Lord God. Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the  Gentiles, and set my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in  their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</p> <p>21:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and thy queens thy nursing  mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick  up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: for they shall  not be ashamed that wait for me.</p> <p>21:24 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives  delivered?</p> <p>21:25 But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken  away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with  him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</p> <p>21:26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall  be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know  that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>22:1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, after that I had read these  things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me  and said unto me, What meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they  to be understood according to the spirit and not the flesh?</p> <p>22:2 And I, Nephi, sayeth unto them, Behold, they were made manifest unto the  prophet, by the voice of the spirit: for by the spirit are all things made known  unto the prophet, which shall come upon the children of men, according to the  flesh.</p> <p>22:3 Wherefore, the things which I have read, are things pertaining to things  both temporal and spiritual: for it appears that the House of Israel, sooner or  later, will be scattered upon all the face of the earth, and also among all  nations,</p> <p>22:4 and before there are many which are already lost from the knowledge of  they which are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led  away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea: and wither  they are, none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.</p> <p>22:5 And since that they have been led away, these things have been  prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all they which shall hereafter  be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel: for against  him will they harden their hearts: wherefore, they shall be scattered among all  nations, and shall be hated by all men.</p> <p>22:6 Nevertheless, after that they have been nursed by the Gentiles, and the  Lord hath lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a standard,  and their children shall be carried in their arms, and their daughters shall be  carried upon their shoulders, behold, these things of which are spoken, are  temporal: for thus is the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth  us in the days to come, and also our brethren which are of the House of Israel.</p> <p>22:7 And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the House of Israel  have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty  nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them  shall our seed be scattered.</p> <p>22:8 And after that our seed is scattered, the Lord God will proceed to do a  marvellous work among the gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed;  wherefore, it is likened unto the being nourished by the Gentiles, and being  carried in their arms, and upon their shoulders.</p> <p>22:9 And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the  Gentiles, but unto all the House of Israel, unto the making known of the  covenants of the Father of Heaven unto Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all  the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p> <p>22:10 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of  the earth cannot be blessed, unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of  the nations.</p> <p>22:11 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes  of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his Gospel, unto they  which are of the House of Israel.</p> <p>22:12 Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be  gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought  out of obscurity, and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is  their Saviour and their Redeemer, the mighty one of Israel.</p> <p>22:13 And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore  of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads: for they shall war among  themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads,  and they shall be drunken with their own blood.</p> <p>22:14 And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall  be turned one against another, and they shall fall into the pit which they  digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight against Zion, shall  be destroyed. And that great whore, which hath perverted the right ways of the  Lord; yea, that great and abominable church, shall stumble to the dust, and  great shall be the fall of it.</p> <p>22:15 For behold, saith the prophet, that the times cometh speedily, that  Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men: for the  day soon cometh, that all the proud and they which do wickedly, shall be as  stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned.</p> <p>22:16 For the time soon cometh, that the fulness of the wrath of God shall be  poured out upon all the children of men: for he will not suffer that the wicked  shall destroy the righteous.</p> <p>22:17 Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so  be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even  unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not  fear: for thus saith the prophet, They shall be saved, even if it be so as by  fire.</p> <p>22:18 Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must shortly  come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must come; and it must needs  be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to the flesh,  if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel:</p> <p>22:19 for behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must  come, that all they which fight against Zion, shall be cut off.</p> <p>22:20 And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the  fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the  Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things  whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all they which  will not hear that prophet, shall be cut off from among the people.</p> <p>22:21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom Moses  spake, was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in  righteousness;</p> <p>22:22 and the righteous need not fear, for it is they which shall not be  confounded. But it is the kingdom of the Devil, which shall be built up among  the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the  flesh:</p> <p>22:23 for the time speedily shall come, that all churches which are built up  to get gain, and they which are built up to get power over the flesh, and they  which are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and they which  seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and do all manner of  iniquity; yea, in fine, all they which belong to the kingdom of the Devil, it is  they which need fear, and tremble, and quake; it is they which must be brought  low in the dust; it is they which must be consumed as stubble: and this is  according to the words of the prophet.</p> <p>22:24 And the time cometh speedily, that the righteous must be led up as  calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and  might, and power, and great glory.</p> <p>22:25 And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and  he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one  shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.</p> <p>22:26 And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan, hath no power;  wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years: for he hath no power  over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One  of Israel reigneth.</p> <p>22:27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you, that all these things must  come, according to the flesh.</p> <p>22:28 But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, shall dwell  safely in the Holy One of Israel, if it so be that they will repent.</p> <p>22:29 And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further as yet,  concerning these things.</p> <p>22:30 Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye consider that the things which  have been written upon the plates of brass, are true; and they testify that a  man must be obedient to the commandments of God.</p> <p>22:31 Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones  that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to  the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And  thus it is. Amen.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
