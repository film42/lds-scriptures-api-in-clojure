    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1830 Book of Mormon<br />Mormon</strong></h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1:1 And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen and  heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.</p> <p>1:2 And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the Lord, he came  unto me, (I being about ten years of age; and I began to be learned somewhat  after the manner of the learning of my people, ) And Ammaron saith unto me, I  perceive that thou art a sober child, and art quick to observe;</p> <p>1:3 therefore when ye are about twenty and four years old, I would that ye  should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people; and  when ye are of that age, go to the land of Antum, unto a hill, which is called  Shim; and there have I deposited unto the Lord, all the sacred engravings  concerning this people.</p> <p>1:4 And behold, ye shall take the plates of Nephi unto yourself, and the  remainder shall ye leave in the place where they are; and ye shall engrave upon  the plates of Nephi, all the things which ye have observed concerning this  people.</p> <p>1:5 And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father's name was  Mormon,) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded me.</p> <p>1:6 And it came to pass that I being eleven years old, was carried by my  father into the land southward, even to the land of Zarahemla:</p> <p>1:7 the whole face of the land having become covered with buildings, and the  people were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of the sea.</p> <p>1:8 And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war between the  Nephites, which consisted of the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the  Josephites, and the Zoramites: and this war was between the Nephites and the  Lamanites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites.</p> <p>1:9 Now the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, were called  Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and Lamanites.</p> <p>1:10 And it came to pass that the war began to be among them, in the borders  of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.</p> <p>1:11 And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together a great  number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thousand. And it came to pass  that they did have in this same year a number of battles, in the which the  Nephites did beat the Lamanites, and did slay many of them.</p> <p>1:12 And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design, and there  was peace settled in the land, and peace did remain for the space of about four  years, that there were no blood shed.</p> <p>1:13 But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch  that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and the work of miracles and  of healing did cease, because of the iniquity of the people.</p> <p>1:14 And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come  upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.</p> <p>1:15 And I, being fifteen years of age, and being somewhat of a sober mind,  therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted , and knew of the goodness of  Jesus.</p> <p>1:16 And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut,  and I were forbidden that I should preach unto them: for behold they had  wilfully rebelled against their God, and the beloved disciples were taken away  out of the land, because of their iniquity.</p> <p>1:17 But I did remain among them, but I were forbidden that I should preach  unto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because of the hardness  of their hearts, the land was cursed for their sake.</p> <p>1:18 And these Gaddianton robbers, which were among the Lamanites, did infest  the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began to hide up their treasures  in the earth; and they became slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land,  that they could not hold them, nor retain them again.</p> <p>1:19 And it came to pass that there were sorceries, and witchcrafts, and  magics: and the power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face of the land,  even unto the fulfilling of all the words of Abinadi, and also Samuel the  Lamanite.</p> <p>2:1 And it came to pass in that same year, there began to be a war again  between the Nephites and the Lamanites. And notwithstanding I being young, was  large in stature, therefore the people of Nephi appointed me that I should be  their leader, or the leader of their armies.</p> <p>2:2 Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth year, I did go forth at  the head of an army of the Nephites, against the Lamanites; therefore three  hundred and twenty and six years had passed away.</p> <p>2:3 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and seventh  year, the Lamanites did come upon us with exceeding great power, insomuch that  they did frighten my armies; therefore they would not fight, and they began to  retreat towards the north countries.</p> <p>2:4 And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angelah, and we did  take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend ourselves against  the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did fortify the city with our mights;  but notwithstanding all our fortifications, the Lamanites did come upon us, and  did drive us out of the city.</p> <p>2:5 And they did also drive us forth out of the land of David.</p> <p>2:6 And we marched forth, and came to the land of Joshua, which was in the  border west by the seashore.</p> <p>2:7 And it came to pass that we did gather our people as fast as it were  possible, that we might get them together in one body.</p> <p>2:8 But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with Lamanites; and  notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they did not  repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread  throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites, and also  on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all  the face of the land.</p> <p>2:9 And now the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he came  against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And behold, I withstood him,  with forty and two thousand. And it came to pass that I beat him with my army,  that he fled before me. And behold, all this was done, and three hundred and  thirty years had passed away.</p> <p>2:10 And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity,  and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet: for behold  no man could keep that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and  the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.</p> <p>2:11 Thus there began to be mourning and lamentation in all the land, because  of these things; and more especially among the people of Nephi.</p> <p>2:12 And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation, and  their mourning, and their sorrowing before the Lord, my heart did begin to  rejoice within me: knowing the mercies and the long suffering of the Lord,  therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them, that they would again  become a righteous people.</p> <p>2:13 But behold this my joy was in vain, for their sorrowing was not unto  repentance, because of the goodness of God, but it was rather the sorrowing of  the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in  sin.</p> <p>2:14 And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and contrite  spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they would  struggle with the sword for their lives.</p> <p>2:15 And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw  that the day of grace was past with them, both temporally and spiritually: for I  saw thousands of them hewn down in open rebellion against their God, and heaped  up as dung upon the face of the land. And thus three hundred and forty and four  years had passed away.</p> <p>2:16 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and fifth year,  the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites, and they were pursued until  they came even to the land of Jashon, before it were possible to stop them in  their retreat.</p> <p>2:17 And now the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had deposited  the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I had  gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did  make a record according to the words of Ammaron.</p> <p>2:18 And upon the plates of Nephi, I did make a full account of all the  wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make a full  account of their wickedness and abominations: for behold, a continual scene of  wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been  sufficient to behold the ways of man.</p> <p>2:19 And wo is me, because of their wickedness: for my heart has been filled  with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I know that  I shall be lifted up at the last day.</p> <p>2:20 And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were  hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had  come northward to the land which was called Shem.</p> <p>2:21 And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and we did  gather in our people in as much as it were possible, that perhaps we might save  them from destruction.</p> <p>2:22 And it came to pass in the three hundred and forty and sixth year, they  began to come upon us again.</p> <p>2:23 And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge them  with great energy, that they would stand boldly before the Lamanites, and fight  for their wives, and their children, and their houses and their homes.</p> <p>2:24 And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they did  not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand with boldness against them.</p> <p>2:25 And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand,  against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand before  them with such firmness, that they did flee from before us.</p> <p>2:26 And it came to pass that when they had fled, we did pursue them with our  armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them; nevertheless the strength of  the Lord was not with us: yea, we were left to ourselves, that the spirit of the  Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak, like unto our brethren.</p> <p>2:27 And my heart did sorrow because of this great calamity of my people;  because of their wickedness and their abominations. But behold we did go forth  against the Lamanites, and the robbers of Gaddianton, until we had again taken  possession of the lands of our inheritance.</p> <p>2:28 And the three hundred and forty and ninth year had passed away. And in  three hundred and fiftieth year, we made a treaty with the Lamanites and the  robbers of Gaddianton, in which we did get the lands of our inheritance divided.</p> <p>2:29 And the Lamanites did give unto us the land northward; yea, even to the  narrow passage which led into the land southward. And we did give unto the  Lamanites all the land southward.</p> <p>3:1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle again until  ten years more had passed away. And behold, I had employed my people, the  Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms against the time of battle.</p> <p>3:2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me, Cry unto this people  repent ye, and come unto me and be baptized, and build up again my church, and  ye shall be spared.</p> <p>3:3 And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain, and they did not  realise that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a  chance for repentance. And behold, they did harden their hearts against the Lord  their God.</p> <p>3:4 And it came to pass that after the tenth year had passed away, making in  the whole, three hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of  the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to know that they were  preparing to come again to battle against us.</p> <p>3:5 And it came to pass that they should gather themselves together at the  land Desolation, to a city which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which  lead into the land southward.</p> <p>3:6 And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the  Lamanites, that they might not get possession of any of our lands; therefore we  did fortify against them with all our force.</p> <p>3:7 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and first year,  the Lamanites did come down to the city of Desolation to battle, against us. And  it came to pass that in that year, we did beat them, insomuch that they did  return to their own lands again.</p> <p>3:8 And in the three hundred and sixty and second year, they did come down  again to battle. And we did beat them again, and did slay a great number of  them, and their dead was cast into the sea.</p> <p>3:9 And now because of this great thing which my people, the Nephites, had  done, they began to boast in their own strength, and began to swear before the  heavens that they would avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren which  had been slain by their enemies.</p> <p>3:10 And they did swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of God, that  they would go up to battle against their enemies, and would cut them off from  the face of the land.</p> <p>3:11 And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from this time  forth, to be a commander and a leader of this people, because of their  wickedness and abomination.</p> <p>3:12 Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness, I had lead  them many times to battle, and had loved them, according to the love of God  which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer  unto my God all the day long, for them; nevertheless it was without faith,  because of the hardness of their hearts.</p> <p>3:13 And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and  they have repented of their sins.</p> <p>3:14 And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them, by our Lord  and Saviour Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto their enemies to battle,  and avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren, behold, the voice of the  Lord came unto me saying:</p> <p>3:15 Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and because this people repented  not after that I had delivered them, behold, they shall be cut off from the face  of the earth.</p> <p>3:16 And it came to pass that I utterly refused to go up against mine  enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I did stand as an idle  witness to manifest unto the world the things which I saw and heard, according  to the manifestations of the spirit which had testified of things to come.</p> <p>3:17 Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of  Israel, when the work shall commence that ye shall be about to prepare to return  to the land of your inheritance;</p> <p>3:18 yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea, unto you,  twelve tribes of Israel. which shall be judged according to your works, by the  twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples in the land of Jerusalem.</p> <p>3:19 And I write also unto the remnant of this people, which shall also be  judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the land of Jerusalem.</p> <p>3:20 And these things do the spirit manifest unto me; therefore I write unto  you all. And for this cause I write unto you, that ye may know that ye must all  stand before the judgment seat of Christ, yea, every soul which belong to the  whole human family of Adam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works,  whether they be good or evil;</p> <p>3:21 and also that ye may believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which ye shall  have among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall  have other witness besides that which they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they  slew, was the very Christ, and the very God;</p> <p>3:22 and I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent and  prepare to stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>4:1 And now it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and third  year, the Nephites did go up with their armies to battle against the Lamanites,  out of the land Desolation.</p> <p>4:2 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back  again to the land of Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of  the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the  Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and did slay many of the  Nephites, and did take many prisoners;</p> <p>4:3 and the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city Teancum.  Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and it was also near  the city Desolation.</p> <p>4:4 And it was because of the Nephites went up unto the Lamanites, that they  began to be smitten: for were it not for that, the Lamanites could have no power  over them.</p> <p>4:5 But behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked; and it is by  the wicked, that the wicked are punished: for it is the wicked that stireth up  the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.</p> <p>4:6 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparation to come  against the city Teancum.</p> <p>4:7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year, the  Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they might take possession of  the city Teancum also.</p> <p>4:8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the  Nephites. And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the Lamanites, they did  again boast of their strength; and they went forth in their own might, and took  possession again of the city Desolation.</p> <p>4:9 And now all these things had been done and there had been thousands slain  on both sides, both the Nephites and the Lamanites.</p> <p>4:10 And it came to pass that the three hundred and sixty and sixth year had  passed away, and the Lamanites came again upon the Nephites to battle; and yet  the Nephites repented not of the evil which they had done, but persisted in  their wickedness continually.</p> <p>4:11 And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for a man to write a  perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and a carnage which was  among the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and every heart was  hardened, so that they delighted in shedding of blood continually.</p> <p>4:12 And there never had been so great wickedness among all the children of  Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel, according to the words of the  Lord, as were among this people.</p> <p>4:13 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take possession of the city  Desolation, and this because their number did exceed the number of the Nephites.</p> <p>4:14 And they did also march forward against the city Teancum, and did drive  the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many prisoners of women and of  children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto their idol gods.</p> <p>4:15 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and seventh  year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had sacrificed their women  and their children, that they did go against the Lamanites with exceeding anger,  insomuch that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive them out of their  lands;</p> <p>4:16 and the Lamanites did not come again against the Nephites, until the  three hundred and seventy and fifth year.</p> <p>4:17 And in this year they did come down against the Nephites with all their  powers; and they were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number.</p> <p>4:18 And from this time forth did the Nephites gain no power over the  Lamanites, but began to be swept off by them even as a dew before the sun.</p> <p>4:19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come down against the city of  Desolation; and there was an exceeding sore battle fought in the land  Desolation, in which they did beat the Nephites.</p> <p>4:20 And they fled again from before them, and they came to the city Beaz;  and there they did stand against the Lamanites with exceeding boldness, insomuch  that the Lamanites did not beat them until they had come again the second time.</p> <p>4:21 the Nephites were driven and slaughtered with an exceeding great  slaughter; their women and their children were again sacrificed unto idols.</p> <p>4:22 And it came to pass that the Nephites did again flee from before them,  taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns and villages.</p> <p>4:23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to overthrow the  land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did take all the records which  Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.</p> <p>5:1 And it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did  repent of the oath which I made, That I would no more assist them; and they gave  me command again of their armies: for they looked upon me as though I could  deliver them from their afflictions.</p> <p>5:2 But behold, I was without hopes, for I knew the judgments of the Lord  which should come upon them: for they repented not of their iniquities, but did  struggle for their lives, without calling upon that Being who had created them.</p> <p>5:3 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against us as we fled to  the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven back that they did not take the  city at that time.</p> <p>5:4 And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we did maintain  the city. And there were also other cities which were maintained by the  Nephites, which strong holds did cut them off that they could not get into the  country which lay before us to destroy the inhabitants of our land.</p> <p>5:5 But it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by, and the  inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the Lamanites, and  their towns, and villages, and cities were burned with fire; and thus the three  hundred and seventy and nine years passed away.</p> <p>5:6 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year, the  Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against them  boldly; but it was all in vain, for so great were their numbers that they did  tread the people of the Nephites under their feet.</p> <p>5:7 And it came to pass that we did again take to flight, and they whose  flight were swifter than the Lamanites did escape, and they whose flight did not  exceed the Lamanites, were swept down and destroyed.</p> <p>5:8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the souls of men in  casting before them such an awful scene of blood and carnage as was laid before  mine eyes, but I, knowing that these things must surely be made known, and that  all things which are hid must be revealed upon the house tops,</p> <p>5:9 and also that a knowledge of these things must come unto the remnant of  these people, and also unto the Gentiles, which the Lord hath said should  scatter this people, and this people should be counted as nought among them,  therefore I write a small abridgement, daring not to give a full account of the  things which I have seen, because of the commandment which I have received, and  also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this  people.</p> <p>5:10 And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles,  which hath care for the house of Israel, that realize and know from whence their  blessings come:</p> <p>5:11 For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the house of  Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of this people; they will  sorrow that this people had not repented, that they might have been clasped in  the arms of Jesus.</p> <p>5:12 Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of Jacob; and  they are written after the manner, because it is known of God that wickedness  will not bring them forth unto them; and they are to be hid up unto the Lord,  that they may come forth in his own due time.</p> <p>5:13 And this is the commandment which I have received; and behold they shall  come forth according to the commandment of the Lord, when he shall see fit, in  his wisdom.</p> <p>5:14 And behold they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and for this  intent shall they go: that they may be persuaded that Jesus is the Christ, the  Son of the living God; that the Father may bring about, through his most  beloved, his great and eternal purpose, in the restoring the Jews or all the  house of Israel, to the land of their inheritance, which the Lord their God hath  given them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant,</p> <p>5:15 and also that the seed of this people may more fully believe his gospel,  which shall go forth unto them from the Gentiles: for this people shall be  scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and loathsome people beyond the  description of that which ever hath been amongst us; yea, even that which hath  been among the Lamanites; and this because of their unbelief and idolatry:</p> <p>5:16 For behold, the spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive with  their fathers, and they are without Christ and God in the world, and they are  driven about as chaff before the wind.</p> <p>5:17 They were once a delightsome people, and they had Christ for their  Shepherd; yea, they were led even by God the Father.</p> <p>5:18 But now, behold they are led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven  before the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or  anchor, or without any thing wherewith to steer her; and even as she is, so are  they.</p> <p>5:19 And behold, the Lord hath reserved their blessing, which they might have  received in the land, for the Gentiles, which shall possess the land.</p> <p>5:20 But behold, it shall come to pass that they shall be driven and  scattered by the Gentiles; and after that they have been driven and scattered by  the Gentiles, behold, then will the Lord remember the covenant which he made  unto Abraham, and unto all the house of Israel.</p> <p>5:21 And also the Lord will remember the prayers of the righteous, which hath  been put up unto him for them.</p> <p>5:22 And then, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of God,  except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways?</p> <p>5:23 Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he hath  all power, and at his great command the earth shall be rolled together as a  scroll?</p> <p>5:24 Therefore repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall  come out in justice against you; lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go  forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>6:1 And now I finish my record concerning the destruction of my people, the  Nephites. And it came to pass that we did march forth before the Lamanites.</p> <p>6:2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of the Lamanites, and  desired of him that he would grant unto us that we might gather together our  people unto the land of Camorah, by the hill which was called Camorah, and there  we would give them battle.</p> <p>6:3 And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites did grant unto me the  thing which I desired.</p> <p>6:4 And it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of Camorah; and  we did pitch our tents round about the hill of Camorah; and it was in a land of  many waters, rivers and fountains; and here we had hope to gain advantage over  the Lamanites.</p> <p>6:5 And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away, we had  gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the land Camorah.</p> <p>6:6 And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to  the land of Camorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; knowing it to be the  last struggle of my people, and having been commanded of the Lord that I should  not suffer that the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which  were sacred, to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would  destroy them,) therefore I made this record out of the plates of Nephi, and hid  up in the hill of Camorah, all the records which had been entrusted to me by the  hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni.</p> <p>6:7 And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their children,  did now behold the armies of the Lamanites a marching towards them; and with  that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked, did they  await to receive them.</p> <p>6:8 And it came to pass that they came to battle against us, and every soul  was filled with terror, because of the greatness of their numbers.</p> <p>6:9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my people with the sword, and  with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the axe, and with all manner of  weapons of war.</p> <p>6:10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my ten  thousand which were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst; and they passed by  me that they did not put an end to my life.</p> <p>6:11 And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people save it were  twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni,) and we having survived  the dead of our 34 people, did behold on the morrow, when the Lamanites had  returned unto their camps, from the top of the hill Camorah, the ten thousand of  my people which were hewn down, being led in front by me,</p> <p>6:12 and we also beheld the ten thousand of my people which were led by my  son Moroni.</p> <p>6:13 And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he also in  the midst;</p> <p>6:14 and Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen with  his ten thousand; and Limhah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Joneam had  fallen with his ten thousand; and Camenihah and Moronihah, and Antionum, and  Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh, had fallen with their ten thousand each.</p> <p>6:15 And it came to pass that there were ten more which did fall by the  sword, with their ten thousand each; yea, even all my people, save it were those  twenty and four which were with me, and also a few which had escaped into the  south countries, and a few which had dissented over unto the Lamanites, had  fallen, and their flesh, and bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth,  being left by the hands of those who slew them, to moulder upon the land, and to  crumble and to return to their mother earth.</p> <p>6:16 And my soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain of my people:  And I cried,</p> <p>6:17 O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O  ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to  receive you!</p> <p>6:18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. But behold,  ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.</p> <p>6:19 O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands and  wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have fallen!</p> <p>6:20 But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return;</p> <p>6:21 and the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and  these bodies which are now mouldering in corruption, must soon become  incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment seat of Christ,  to be judged according to your works: and if it so be that ye are righteous,  then ye are blessed with your fathers which have gone before you.</p> <p>6:22 O that ye had repented before that this great destruction had come upon  you. But behold, ye are gone, and the Father, yea, the eternal Father of heaven,  knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his justice and mercy.</p> <p>7:1 And now behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of this people  which are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that they  may know of the things of their fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of  the house of Israel; and this is the words which I speak:</p> <p>7:2 Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.</p> <p>7:3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be saved.</p> <p>7:4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no more in  the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be that God shall  command you.</p> <p>7:5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and repent of  all of your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son  of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he  hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in  him is the sting of death swallowed up.</p> <p>7:6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be  raised to stand before his judgment seat.</p> <p>7:7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that  is found guiltless before him at the judgment day, hath it given unto them to  dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the  choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which  is one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.</p> <p>7:8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon  the Gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record,  but also in the record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which  record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.</p> <p>7:9 For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe that; and  if ye believe that, ye will believe this also; and if ye believe this, ye will  know concerning your fathers, and also the marvellous works which were wrought  by the power of God among them;</p> <p>7:10 and ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of Jacob;  therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first covenant; and if it so  be that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized, first with water, then with fire  and with the Holy Ghost, following the example of our Saviour according to that  which he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day of judgment.  Amen.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>8:1 Behold I, Moroni, do finish the record of my father Mormon. Behold, I  have but a few things to write, which things I have been commanded of my father.</p> <p>8:2 And now it came to pass that after the great and tremendous battle at  Camorah, behold, the Nephites which had escaped into the country southward, were  hunted by the Lamanites, until they were all destroyed;</p> <p>8:3 and my father was also killed by them; and I, even I remaineth alone to  write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. But behold, they are gone,  and I fulfil the commandment of my father. And whether they will slay me, I know  not;</p> <p>8:4 therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth: and whither  I go it mattereth not.</p> <p>8:5 Behold, my father hath made this record, and he hath written the intent  thereof. And behold, I would write it also. if I had room upon the plates; but I  have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone: my father hath been slain in  battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how  long that the Lord will suffer that I may live, I know not.</p> <p>8:6 Behold, four hundred years have passed away since the coming of our Lord  and Saviour.</p> <p>8:7 And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites, down from  city to city, and from place to place, even until they are no more; and great  has been their fall; yea, great and marvellous is the destruction of my people,  the Nephites.</p> <p>8:8 and behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it. And behold  also, the Lamanites are at war one with another; and the whole face of this land  is one continual round of murder and bloodshed; and no one knoweth the end of  the war.</p> <p>8:9 And now behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are none, save  it be Lamanites and robbers, that do exist upon the face of the land;</p> <p>8:10 and there are none that do know the true God, save it be the disciples  of Jesus, which did tarry in the land until the wickedness of the people were so  great, that the Lord would not suffer them to remain with the people; and  whether they be upon the face of the land, no man knoweth.</p> <p>8:11 But behold, my father and I have seen them, and they have ministered  unto us.</p> <p>8:12 And whoso receiveth this record and shall not condemn it because of the  imperfections which are in it, the same shall know of greater things than these.  Behold, I am Moroni; and were it possible, I would make all things known unto  you.</p> <p>8:13 Behold, I make an end of speaking concerning this people. I am the son  of Mormon, and my father was a descendant of Nephi;</p> <p>8:14 and I am the same which hideth up this record unto the Lord; the plates  thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly  saith, That no one shall have them to get gain; but the record thereof is of  great worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless.</p> <p>8:15 For none can have power to bring it to light, save it be given him of  God: for God will that it shall be done with and eye singled to his glory, or  the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord.</p> <p>8:16 And blessed be him that shall bring this thing to light: for it shall be  brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall  be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come  unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God:</p> <p>8:17 and if there be faults, they be the faults of a man. But behold, we know  no fault. Nevertheless, God knoweth all things; therefore he that condemneth,  let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire.</p> <p>8:18 And he that sayeth, Shew unto me, or ye shall be smitten, let him beware  lest he commandeth that which is forbidden of the Lord.</p> <p>8:19 For behold, the same that judgeth rashly, shall be judged rashly again:  for according to his works shall his wages be; therefore, he that smiteth, shall  be smitten again of the Lord.</p> <p>8:20 Behold what the Scriptures saith: Man shall not smite, neither shall he  judge: for judgment is mine, saith the Lord; and vengeance is mine also, and I  will repay.</p> <p>8:21 And he that shall breathe out wrath and strifes against the work of the  Lord, and against the covenant people of the Lord, which is the house of Israel,  and shall say, We will destroy the work of the Lord, and the Lord will not  remember his covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel, the same is  in danger to be hewn down and cast into the fire:</p> <p>8:22 for the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all his  promises shall be fulfilled.</p> <p>8:23 Search the prophecies of Isaiah. Behold, I cannot write them. Yea,  behold I say unto you, That those saints which have gone before me, which have  possessed this land, shall cry; yea, even from the dust will they cry unto the  Lord; and the Lord liveth, he will remember the covenant which he hath made with  them.</p> <p>8:24 And he knoweth their prayers, that they were in the behalf of their  brethren. And he knoweth their faith: for in his name could they remove  mountains; and in his name could they cause the earth to shake; and by the power  of his word did they cause prisons to tumble to the earth; yea, even the fiery  furnace could not harm them; neither wild beasts, nor poisonous serpents,  because of the power of his word.</p> <p>8:25 And behold, their prayers were also in behalf of him that the Lord  should suffer to bring these things forth.</p> <p>8:26 And no one need not say, They shall not come, for they surely shall, for  the Lord hath spoken it: for out of the earth shall they come, by the hand of  the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said  that miracles are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak from  the dead.</p> <p>8:27 And it shall come in a day when the blood of saints shall cry unto the  Lord, because of secret combinations and the works of darkness;</p> <p>8:28 yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied, and  churches become defiled, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts;  yea, even in a day when leaders of churches, and teachers, in the pride of their  hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches;</p> <p>8:29 yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be heard of fires, and  tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands;</p> <p>8:30 and there shall also be heard of wars, and rumors of wars, and  earthquakes in diverse places;</p> <p>8:31 yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions upon  the face of the earth: there shall be murders, and robbing, and lying, and  deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations; when there shall be  many which will say, Do this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord  will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the gall of  bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.</p> <p>8:32 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that  shall say, Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins.</p> <p>8:33 O ye wicked and perverse, and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up  churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of  God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the  revelations of God. For behold, the time cometh at that day when all these  things must be fulfilled.</p> <p>8:34 Behold, the Lord hath shewn unto me great and marvellous things  concerning that which must shortly come at that day when these things shall come  forth among you.</p> <p>8:35 Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But  behold, Jesus Christ hath shewn you unto me, and I know your doings;</p> <p>8:36 and I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are  none, save a few only, which do not lift themselves up in the pride of their  hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envyings, and strifes, and  malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea,  even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.</p> <p>8:37 For behold, ye do love money, and your substances, and your fine  apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the  needy, the sick and afflicted.</p> <p>8:38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, which sell yourselves for  that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye  ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is  the value of an endless happiness, than that misery which never dies, because of  the praise of the world?</p> <p>8:39 Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer  the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick, and the afflicted to  pass by you, and notice them not?</p> <p>8:40 Yea, why do ye build up your secret abominations to get gain, and cause  that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also orphans to mourn before the  Lord; and also the blood of their fathers and their husbands to cry unto the  Lord from the ground, for vengeance upon your heads?</p> <p>8:41 Behold, the sword of vengeance hangeth over you; and the time cometh  that he avengeth the blood of the saints upon you, for he will not suffer their  cries any longer.</p> <p>9:1 And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in Christ.</p> <p>9:2 Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation, behold, when the  Lord shall come; yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled  together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; yea, in  that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God, then  will ye say that there is no God?</p> <p>9:3 Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God? Do  ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your guilt? Do  ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls  are racked with a consciousness of your guilt that ye have ever abused his laws?</p> <p>9:4 Behold I say unto you, that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a  holy and just God, under a consciousness of your filthiness before him, than ye  would to dwell with the damned souls in hell?</p> <p>9:5 For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness before God,  and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a  flame of unquenchable fire upon you.</p> <p>9:6 O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the  Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair,  and white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at that great and last  day.</p> <p>9:7 And again I speak unto you, who deny the revelations of God, and say that  they are done away, that there is no revelations, nor prophecies, and the  interpretation of tongues.</p> <p>9:8 Behold I say unto you, He that denieth these things, knoweth not the  Gospel of Christ; yea, they have not read the Scriptures; if so, they do not  understand them.</p> <p>9:9 For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever:  and in him there is no variableness, neither shadow of changing.</p> <p>9:10 And now, if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god which doth vary,  and in him there is shadow of changing, then have ye imagined up unto yourselves  a god which is not a God of miracles. But behold, I will shew unto you a God of  miracles,</p> <p>9:11 even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and  it is that same God which created the heavens and the earth, and all things that  in them is.</p> <p>9:12 Behold, he crated Adam; and by Adam came the fall of man. And because of  the fall of man, came Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and because of  Jesus Christ, came the redemption of man.</p> <p>9:13 And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they  are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are  redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which  bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men  shall be awoke by the power of God, when the trump shall sound; and they shall  come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being  redeemed and loosed from their eternal band of death, which death is a temporal  death;</p> <p>9:14 and then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh  the time that he that is filthy, shall be filthy still; and he that is  righteous, shall be righteous still: he that is happy, shall be happy still; and  he that is unhappy, shall be unhappy still.</p> <p>9:15 And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god which can  do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things past, of which I have  spoken? Has, the end come yet? Behold I say unto you, Nay; and God has not  ceased to be a God of miracles.</p> <p>9:16 Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought, marvellous in our  eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the marvellous works of God?</p> <p>9:17 Who shall say that it was not a miracle, that by his word the heaven and  the earth should be; and by the power of his word, man was created of the dust  of the earth; and by the power of his word, hath miracles been wrought?</p> <p>9:18 And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not do many miracles? And there  was many mighty miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles.</p> <p>9:19 And if there was miracles wrought, then why has God ceased to be God of  miracles, and yet be an unchangeable being. And behold I say unto you, He  changeth not: if so, he would cease to be God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and  is a God of miracles.</p> <p>9:20 And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men,  is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right way, and  know not the God in whom they should trust.</p> <p>9:21 Behold I say unto you, That whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing  what so ever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ, it shall be granted  them: and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends of the earth.</p> <p>9:22 For behold, thus saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his disciples  which should tarry; yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the  multitude, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature;</p> <p>9:23 and he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, but he that  believeth not, shall be damned.</p> <p>9:24 And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they  cast out Devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents;  and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands  on the sick, and they shall recover;</p> <p>9:25 and whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will  I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the earth.</p> <p>9:26 And now behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord? Who can  deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty power of the Lord? Who  will despise the works of the Lord? Who will despise the children of Christ?  Behold, all ye that are despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall wonder  and perish.</p> <p>9:27 O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the  Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall  stand in need. Doubt not, but believing and begin as in times of old, and come  unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and  trembling before him.</p> <p>9:28 Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all  uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with  firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve  the true and living God.</p> <p>9:29 See that ye are baptized unworthily; see that ye partake not of the  sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all things in worthiness, and  do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this,  and endure to the end, ye will in no wise be cast out.</p> <p>9:30 Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from the dead: for I know  that ye shall hear my words.</p> <p>9:31 Condemn me not because of mine imperfection; neither my father, because  of his imperfection; neither them which have written before him, but rather give  thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye  may learn to be more wise than that which we have been.</p> <p>9:32 And now behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge  in the characters, which are called among us the reformed Egyptian being handed  down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech.</p> <p>9:33 And if our plates had been sufficiently large, we should have written in  Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and if we could have  written in the Hebrew, behold, ye would have had none imperfection in our  record.</p> <p>9:34 But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and also that  none other people knoweth our language; and because that none other people  knoweth our language, therefore he hath prepared means for the interpretation  thereof.</p> <p>9:35 And these things are written, that ye may rid our garments of the blood  of our brethren which have dwindled in unbelief.</p> <p>9:36 And behold, these things which we have desired concerning our brethren,  yea, even their restoration to the knowledge of Christ, is according to the  prayers of all the saints which have dwelt in the land.</p> <p>9:37 And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be answered  according to their faith; and may God the Father remember the covenant which he  hath made with the house of Israel; and may he bless them forever, through faith  on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
