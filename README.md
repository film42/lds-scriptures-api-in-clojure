# lds-scriptures-api

Little clojure (compojure + korma) app to see if I could build a scripture api in ~4 hours. Turns out I almost can.


#### Update 04/06/2014:
- Now supports edition version query for Book of Mormon: 1989 and 1830
- Added new Diff util to compare Book of Mormon: 1830 => 1989
- Added 1830 Book of Mormon raw data
- Code cleanup
